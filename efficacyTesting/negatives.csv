review
Once again Mr Costner has dragged out a movie for far longer than necessary Aside from the terrific sea rescue sequences of which there are very few I just did not care about any of the characters Most of us have ghosts in the closet and Costners character are realized early on and then forgotten until much later by which time I did not care The character we should really care about is a very cocky overconfident Ashton Kutcher The problem is he comes off as kid who thinks hes better than anyone else around him and shows no signs of a cluttered closet His only obstacle appears to be winning over Costner Finally when we are well past the half way point of this stinker Costner tells us all about Kutchers ghosts We are told why Kutcher is driven to be the best with no prior inkling or foreshadowing No magic here it was all I could do to keep from turning it off an hour in
This is a pale imitation of Officer and a Gentleman There is NO chemistry between Kutcher and the unknown woman who plays his love interest The dialog is wooden the situations hackneyed Its too long and the climax is anti-climactic(!) I love the USCG its men and women are fearless and tough The action scenes are awesome but this movie doesnt do much for recruiting I fear The script is formulaic but confusing Kutchers character is trying to redeem himself for an accident that wasnt his fault? Costners is raging against the dying of the light but why? His conflict with his wife is about as deep as a mud puddle I saw this sneak preview for free and certainly felt I got my moneys worth
It seems ever since 1982 about every two or three years we get a movie that claims to be The Next Officer and a Gentleman There has yet to be one movie that has lived up to this claim and this movie is no differentbr br We get the usual ripped off scenes from OAAG (I want you DOR the instructor gives the Richard Gere character his overdose of drills in hopes hell quit the Gere character comes back for the girl the Gere character realizes the instructor is great etc) and this movie is as predictable as the sun rising in the East and is horribly miscast on top Costner plays his usual wise teacher character the only character he can play and you really get a sense of his limited acting abilities here Kutcher is terrible in the Richard Gere character just miscast with acting skills barely a notch above Keanu Reevesbr br The main problem with this OAAG wannabe is the two main characters are so amazingly one-dimensional you never care for either in the least and when Kutchers character finally turns around (just like Gere did in OAAG) you just go so what? The movie leaves no plot point unturned and seems to never end as if to say oh wait we forgot to close out the girlfriend story or the what happens after he graduates story or the other six plot points in the movie Whats more baffling is the great reviews I see here The general publics opinions never cease to amaze me
Wow another Kevin Costner hero movie Postman Tin Cup Waterworld Bodyguard Wyatt Earp Robin Hood even that baseball movie Seems like he makes movies specifically to be the center of attention The characters are almost always the same  the heroics the flaws the greatness the fall the redemption Yup within the 1st 5 minutes of the movie were all supposed to be in awe of his character and it builds up more and more from therebr br And this time the story  story?  is just a collage of different movies You dont need a spoiler; youve seen this movie several times though it had different titles Youll know what will happen way before it happens This is like mixing An Officer and a Gentleman with Backdraft but both are easily better movies Watch Backdraft to see how this kind of movie should be made  and also to see how an good but slightly underrated actor Russell plays the hero
Alas another Costner movie that was an hour too long Credible performances but the script had no where to go and was in no hurry to get there First we are offered an unrelated string of events few of which further the story Will the script center on Randall and his wife? Randall and Fischer? How about Fischer and Thomas? In the end no real front story ever develops and the characters themselves are artificially propped up by monologues from third parties The singer explains Randall Randall explains Fischer on and on Finally long after you dont care anymore you will learn something about the script meetings Three endings were no doubt proffered and no one could make a decision The end result? All three were used one after another after another If you can hang in past the 100th yawn youll be able to pick them out Despite the transparent attempt to gain points with a dedication to the Coast Guard this one should have washed out the very first day
I wish I knew what to make of a movie like this It seems to be divided into two parts -- action sequences and personal dramas ashore It follows Ashton Kutsher through survival swimmer school guided by Master Chief Kevin Costner then to Alaska where a couple of spectacular rescues take place the last resulting in deathbr br I must say that the scenes on the beach struck me as so stereotypical in so many ways that they should be barnacle encrusted A typical bar room fight between Navy guys and Coast Guardsmen (puddle pirates) The experienced old timer Costner who is as an elderly bar tender tells him married to the Coast Guard The older chief who keeps trying to prove to himself that hes still nineteen The neglected ex wife ashore to whom Kostner pays a farewell visit The seemingly sadistic demands placed on the swimmers by the instructors all in pursuit of a loftier goal The gifted young man hobbled by a troubled pastbr br The problem is that weve seen it all before If its Kevin Costner here its Clint Eastwood or John Wayne or Lou Gosset Jr or Vigo Mortenson or Robert DeNiro elsewhere And the climactic scene has elements drawn shamelessly from The Perfect Storm and Dead Calm None of it is fresh and none of the old stereotyped characters and situations are handled with any originalitybr br It works best as a kind of documentary of what goes on in the swimmers school and what could happen afterward and even thats a little weak because we dont get much in the way of instruction Its mostly personal conflict romance and tension about washing outbr br Its a shame because the U S Coast Guard is rather a noble outfit its official mission being the safety of lives and property at sea In war time it is transferred to the Navy Department and serves in combat roles In World War II the Coast Guard even managed to have a Medal of Honor winner in its ranksbr br But again we dont learn much about that We dont really learn much about anything The film devolves into a succession of visual displays and not too much else A disappointment
A tough sell: British playwright Ronald Harwood adapts his autobiographical stage drama into loud bellowing film about WWII Shakespearean theatrical troupe saddled with an aged blustery brilliant-but-unreliable star at the end of his tether The actors effete assistant works diligently to get his master coiffed and costumed for a production of King Lear (during an Air Raid!) yet both men are losing their grip on their unraveling situation Based on the waning years of actor Donald Wolfit whose dresser was Ronald Harwood this acclaimed production would seem to be a welcome haven for scenery-chewing thespians Unfortunately Albert Finney (at this point in his career not at all elderly) seems too robust and quick-thinking to play the actor; Finney (and Oscar-nominated director Peter Yates) cannot modulate Sirs moods and bouts of coherency in a way that makes sense to us so that in one scene hes stopping a train with the commanding echo of his voice and in the next hes curiously falling apart With such a wreck of a human being in the midst of failing health and aptitude one would assume a dedicated assistant would go to great lengths to protect his boss (and his future) yet servant Tom Courtenay prods and badgers and goads Finney to carry on rather than rest Courtenay who played this part on stage (and was nominated for an Oscar alongside Finney for Best Actor) is far more attuned to his role and eventually his bleating commands and confusion achieve the only real feeling in the film These two thankfully do not peck at each others heads and scenarist Harwood is careful not to fall into a love-hate pattern (which could possibly be perceived in the films first act); but without a juxtaposition of servant vs celebrity theres nothing much to behold in this portrait except for the deterioration of narcissism the hint at what once was 12 from 
Blake Edwards legendary fiasco begins to seem pointless after just 10 minutes A combination of The Eagle Has Landed Star! Oh! What a Lovely War! and Edwards Pink Panther films Darling Lili never engages the viewer; the aerial sequences the musical numbers the romance the comedy and the espionage are all ho hum At what point is the viewer supposed to give a damn? This disaster wavers in tone never decides what it wants to be and apparently thinks its a spoof but its pathetically and grindingly square Old fashioned in the worst sense audiences understandably stayed away in droves Its awful James Garner would have been a vast improvement over Hudson who is just cardboard and he doesnt connect with Andrews and vice versa And both Andrews and Hudson dont seem to have been let in on the joke and perform with a miscalculated earnestness Blake Edwards SOB isnt much more than OK but its the only good that ever came out of Darling Lili The expensive and professional look of much of Darling Lili only make what its all lavished on even more difficult to bear To quote Paramount chief Robert Evans 24 million dollars worth of film and no picture
Im not a big fan of musicals although this technically might not qualify as a musical But I thought I would give it a chance as I love war movies It was mediocre at bestbr br Hudson seems totally out of kilter in this role It just didnt work for me Julie Andrews probably played her part as best as she could but I just find it hard to buy her as a conniving deceptive spy Sorry I know that is classic stereotyping on my part But I have to say I think this is Julie at her most beautiful and feminine looking I always thought of her as more matronly but then surely thats a result of her roles in Sound of Music and Mary Poppins No doubt they were desperately trying to get her out of that typecasting in this role She was quite beguiling in appearance here but I still didnt buy her as a spybr br I couldnt keep my focus through the whole movie and found myself tuning in and out - and having conversations with those in my room (which I usually never do - Im always shushing everybody) So that tells you how little it held my attention Dont waste your time!
David Bryces comments nearby are exceptionally well written and informative as almost say everything I feel about DARLING LILI This massive musical is so peculiar and over blown over produced and must have caused ruptures at Paramount in 1970 It cost 22 million dollars! That is simply irresponsible DARLING LILI must have been greenlit from a board meeting that said hey we got that Pink Panther guy and that Sound Of Music gal lets get this too and handed over a blank cheque The result is a hybrid of GIGI ZEPPELIN HALF A SIXPENCE some MGM 40s song and dance numbers of a style (daisies and boaters!) so hopelessly old fashioned as to be like musical porridge and MATA HARI dramatics The production is colossal lush breathtaking to view but the rest: the ridiculous romance Julie looking befuddled Hudson already dead the mistimed comedy and the astoundingly boring songs deaden this spectacular film into being irritating LILI is like a twee 1940s mega musical with some vulgar bits to spice it up STAR! released the year before sadly crashed and now is being finally appreciated for the excellent film is genuinely is and Andrews looks sublime mature especially in the last half hourbut LILI is POPPINS and DOLLY frilly and I believe really killed off the mega musical binge of the 60s and made Andrews look like Poppins again which I believe was not Edwards intention Paramount must have collectively fainted when they saw this: and with another $20 million festering in CATCH 22 and $12 million in ON A CLEAR DAY and $25 million in PAINT YOUR WAGONthey had a financial abyss of CLEOPATRA proportions with $77 million tied into 4 films with very uncertain futures Maybe they should have asked seer Daisy Gamble from ON A CLEAR DAY LILI was very popular on immediate first release in Australia and ran in 70mm cinemas for months but it failed once out in the subs and the sticks and only ever surfaced after that on one night stands with ON A CLEAR DAY as a Sunday night double Thank god Paramount had their simple $1million (yes ONE MILLION DOLLAR) film LOVE STORY and that $4 million dollar gangster pic THE GODFATHER also ready to recover all the $77 million in just the next two yearsfor just $5m incredible!
Years ago when DARLING LILI played on TV it was always the pan and scan version which I hated and decided to wait and see the film in its proper widescreen format So when I saw an inexpensive DVD of this Julie AndrewsBlake Edwards opus I decided to purchase and watch it once and for allbr br Boy what a terrible film Its so bad and on so many levels that I really do not know where to start in describing where and when it goes so horribly wrong Looking at it now its obvious to any fans of movies that Blake Edwards created this star vehicle for his wife simply because so many other directors had struck gold with Andrews in musicals (MARY POPPINS SOUND OF MUSIC THOROUGHLY MODERN MILLIE etc) but also because Andrews was snubbed from starring in projects made famous on stage by Julie herself (CAMELOT MY FAIR LADY etc) because Hollywood thought she wasnt sexy or glamorous enough So Blake created this stillborn effort to showcase his wife in a bizarre concoction of spy storywar movieromanceslapstick comedymusical DARLING LILI suffers from multiple personalities never knowing who or what it is Some specific scenes are good or effective but as a whole it just doesnt work at all to a point of it being very embarrassingbr br Mind you the version on the DVD is the directors cut or in this case lets salvage whatever we can from this notorious box office flop In releasing the DVD Edwards cut 19 scenes (19!!!!!!!!) from the original bloated theatrical version into this more streamlined and yet remarkably ineffective version The film moves along with no idea of what it is We are 25 minutes into it and we still dont know whats going on or why were watching whats going What kind of spy is Lili? How powerful is she? Was she ever responsible for someones death? Instead we watch a thoroughly bored looking Rock Hudson trying to woo a thoroughly bored looking Julie Andrews Things arent helped much with the inexplicable reason why the two fall in love Why does Julie fall for Hudson? Why him and not other men she got involved with? There should have been one of her ex hanging around trying to win her back or trying to decipher her secret This would have given us some much needed contrast to the muddled action It would also have given us some impetuous to the sluggish proceedings Theres no catalyst in this storybr br One only has to look at the cut scenes to clearly see that Edwards and the writer just came up with ideas inspired by Andrews (and Edwards) previous successes The best (or worst) example is the scene when Andrews and Hudson follows a group of children who sing in the middle of a forest Edwards channeling SOUND OF MUSIC Its no wonder he removed it from the DVD Back in 1970 that scene might have worked on a certain level but today that moment reeks of desperation There are other plot elements directly inspired by AndrewsEdwards other films The endless scenes of dogfights is inspired by the much better MODERN MILLIE The musical moment Ill give you three guesses was created just to make fun of Julies MARY POPPINS persona which is turned raunchy with Julie doing a striptease in the act The ending birds eye view of Julie running towards Hudsons plane is another wink at SOUND OF MUSICbr br The whole thing is confusing Julie plays a singer born from a German father and British mother who lives in England but sings her (English) songs in Paris You never know exactly where the story takes place Some moments are just badly edited Like when Julie and her uncle are on horseback They talk and talk and then Julie suddenly sprints off in mid-sentence Im like what happened here?br br The comedy bits are unfunny and cringe-worthy Every scene with the French police are pathetic Wheres Peter Sellers when you really need him The action is stupid beyond belief When Julie and her uncle are on their way to Germany on that train Hudsons squadron shoots rounds of bullets at the train almost killing Lili in the process Brilliant Whats also funny about that scene is the two leave on the train in the middle of the night but Hudson and his squadron reach the train even though they fly off the next morning Thats one slow moving train there br br The musical moments The beginning is the best part of the entire film (and the reason I gave this film 3 stars) but its effect is diminished considerably because its repeated at the end Speaking of redundant did we really need to see a can-can dance Crepe Suzette stripping scene and Julie stripping too? The Girl in no mans land is OK even if its bleeding obvious but that moment just doesnt make any sense whatsoever because Lili sings it to a group of injured soldiers at a French hospital making me wonder: how many soldiers there were injured indirectly by the result of her spying?br br The whole project is listless and without energy The romance is 100% unbelievable Rock Hudson is way too old and tired looking (check out the museum scene) Julie looks dazed like shes on Valium But what really kills this ill-conceived project is Julie playing a German spy Edwards desperately wanted to dispel the Mary Poppins syndrome afflicting his wife and believed that playing a traitor was a good career decision As much as I like Julie shes no Greta Garbo who pulled it off so beautifully in MATA HARI Funny enough even if Julie plays a German spy she still comes across as cloying and cutebr br How bad is DARLING LILI? Even after 37 years since its release Blake Edwards felt he still needed to work on it for its DVD release
Julie Andrews satirically prods her own goody-two-shoes image in this overproduced musical comedy-drama but if she approaches her role with aplomb shes alone in doing so Blake Edwards film about a woman who is both music-hall entertainer and German spy during WWI doesnt know what tone to aim for and Rock Hudson has the thankless task of playing romantic second-fiddle Musicals had grown out of favor by 1970 and elephantine productions like Star! and this film really tarnished Andrews reputation leaving a lot of dead space in her catalogue until The Tamarind Seed came along Ive always thought Julie Andrews wouldve made a great villain or shady lady; her strong voice could really command attention and she hits some low notes that can either be imposing or seductive Husbanddirector Edwards seems to realize this but neither he nor Julie can work up much energy within this scenario Screenwriter William Peter Blatty isnt a good partner for Edwards and neither man has his heart in this material Beattys script offers Andrews just one fabulous sequence--a striptease 12 from 
Blake Edwards tried very hard to change Julie Andrews image in this film He tried to make her sexy not realizing she already was I think they were both still a bit irked that Julie had not been chosen to film her Broadway success of Camelot and was passed over as not being sexy enough Unfortunately they chose this vehicle to try and assuage this belief It gets to the point where it is almost funny seeing Rock Hudson who we all know now was gay kissing Julie every 2 minutes throughout this movie It seems now that they were not only trying to make you believe that Julie was a femme fatale but that Rock was straight Sadly they have absolutely no chemistry together and the unending kissing scenes start grossing one out The other error they made with this picture was not knowing what kind of movie they were making It is almost three separate movies There is the drama of Julie as the German spy trying to get military secrets from Rock There is an air war movie with lots of footage of WWI vintage planes swooping about and there is the stupid attempts at humor that Blake Edwards seems to think he has to insert in every one of his pictures whether it is appropriate or not In this case it was not The only truly redeeming qualities in this film are looking at the always lovely Dame Julie and hearing her sing in that crystal clear bell-like soprano Of course if you love her you may overlook the weaknesses of this film just because of her You can always tell yourself afterward that it was a hell of a lot better than sitting through STAR!
An obvious vanity press for Julie in her first movie with Blake Lets see Where do we begin She is a traitor during a world war; she redeems that by falling in love; her friends (who are presumably patriots because they are German citizens) are expendable and must die; and she winds up as a heroine OK The scenes with the drunken pilot and the buffoons who work for French intelligence cant even be described and we wont even mention Rocks romantic scenes with a female (By the way when they visit a museum look at his gaze - I reran it on video and its priceless) Is it a farce or is it a romantic classic or is it a war movie? I dont know and you wont either
Some may go for a film like this but I most assuredly did not A college professor David Norwell suddenly gets a yen for adoption He pretty much takes the first child offered a bad choice named Adam As it turns out Adam doesnt have both oars in the water which almost immediately causes untold stress and turmoil for Dr Norwell This sob story drolly played out with one problem after another all centered around Adams inabilities and seizures Why Norwell wanted to complicate his life with an unknown factor like an adoptive child was never explained Along the way the good doctor managed to attract a wifey to share in all the hell the little one was dishing out Personally I think both of them were one beer short of a sixpack Bypass this yawner
Few movies have dashed expectations and upset me as much as Fire has The movie is pretentious garbage It does not achieve anything at an artistic level The only thing it managed to receive is a ban in India If only it was because of the poor quality of film making rather than the topical controversy the ban would have been more justifiablebr br Now that Ive got my distress out of my system I am more able to analyse the movie: br br  From the onset the movie feels unreal especially when the protagonists start conversing in English The director of course did not make the movie for an Indian audience; however it underestimated its international audiences by over simplifying it Watching the character of the domestic help conversing in perfect English is too unreal to be truebr br  Next we get regular glimpses into Radhas dreams These scenes are not very effective They coming up as jarring and obstruct the flow of the movie Im still wondering how that philosophical dialogue connected to the story I felt that the surrealism was lostbr br  The love scenes felt voyeuristic and are probably meant for audience titillation rather than being a powerful statement In any case they do not achieve either of the twobr br  The names chosen for the women Radha and Sita are names of Hindu deities and hence been selected to shock the audiences However since the film wasnt meant for Indian audiences in the first place the shock-through-name-selection is not meant to achieve its goal which is absurdbr br  The quality of direction is very poor and some key and delicate scenes have been poorly handled A better director could have made a powerful emotional drama out of the subjectbr br  The acting felt wooden although Nandita Das brought some life into the role the others were wasted I always thought that Shabana Azmi was a good actress but her talent is not evident in this film The male leads were outright rubbishbr br In case you are a fan of Earth and wish to see more of the director stay away from this one Please
For years Ive been a big fan of Parks work and Old boy is one of my all-times favoritebr br With lots of expectation I rented this movie only to find the worst movie Ive watched in awhile Its not a proper horror movie; theres no suspense in it and even the light part is so lame that I didnt know whether to laugh or crybr br I introduced my younger brother to Chan-Wook Park and what a disappointment he got from this For me an idol has fallenbr br If you loved movies like Old boy the Mr & Lady Vengeance or even his short films on Three extremes dont waste your time the films not worth it
Might end up being the biggest disappointment that I will see in 2009 I seem to be the rare person who disliked Parks Oldboy but I think that his Lady Vengeance and Sympathy for Mr Vengeance are among the best films Ive seen in the 2000s decade Therefore I really was looking forward to see this especially as it got such positive reviews Instead I found the film clichéd and broke little if any new ground to the vampire genre And while I can appreciate a bit of gallows humor in movies like this I felt Park did this at very inopportune timesbr br Others have comparedcontrasted this to Let the Right One In and I have to say that Let the Right One In was far superior to this one and was a fresh take on the vampire genre Sadly Parks take was a tired one
Bloody Birthday opens to a shot of Meadowvale General Hospital There three babies are being born at precisely the same time during a total eclipse A caption informs us that it is now Meadowvale California June 1 1980 Two teenage lovers Duke Benson (Ben Marley) and Annie Smith (Erica Hope) are getting down to business in an open grave They hear noises and Duke investigates Both Duke and Annie are murdered Sheriff Jim Brody (Bert Kramer) is baffled and only has the handle of a childs skipping rope that Annie was holding as a clue Unfortunately before Sheriff Brody can solve the case his youngest daughter Debbie (Elizabeth Hoy) and two of her friends Curtis Taylor (Billy Jayne as Billy Jacoby) and Steven Seton (Andy Freeman) murder him Just as they are finishing Sheriff Brody off another young boy from their class named Timmy Russel (KC Martel) turns up the three killers are unaware of how much he saw Soon after the incident Timmy plays with Steven and Curtis in a junkyard Curtis locks Timmy into an old locker Timmy manages to escape and tell his sister Joyce (Lori Lethin) but she doesnt believe him at first The three children carry on their murder spree Their strict teacher Miss Davis (Susan Strasberg) a lovemaking couple (John Avery and Sylvia Wright) in a van and Debbies older sister Beverly (Julie Brown) are among their victims Joyce begins to have her suspicions about Debbie Curtis and Steven which makes her and Timmy a target for the evil trio Will they be able to convince the authorities that these three innocent looking 10 year olds are really soulless killers?br br Co-written and directed by Ed Hunt I have an intense dislike for this film I think its absolutely awful and doesnt have a single enjoyable aspect to its 83 minute running time The script by Hunt and Barry Pearson gives us no explanation for the child killers motives beyond the solar eclipse that blocks out Saturn and therefore for some bizarre astrological reason these three children dont have any conscience so these are the only children ever born during a total eclipse? If that is true why do they wait until just before their tenth birthdays before starting their killing spree? I guess it just suddenly kicks in right? To its credit it is reasonably well paced but I still found it incredibly boring and tedious to sit through The film as a whole is very unexciting and predictable the children are revealed as the killers within the first 10 minutes and as Ive mentioned next to no motive is given Its very silly at times too Check out the scene where Debbie stops Steven by throwing a bowl of water over him! The Sheriffs death is put down to him falling down some steps yeah right the injuries suffered from that type of accident arent going to be the same as if your beaten to death with a baseball bat like he was in reality any competent Doctor or Pathologist would have spotted that within 5 seconds There isnt a single drop of blood spilt in the entire film and all of the lame killings are dull and unimaginative There is some out-of-place looking nudity as Debbie charges 25c to let boys peek through a hole while her sister Beverly strips There is an early scene just after the 5 minute mark when Joyce walks from the kitchen to the living room and the boom mike is clearly visible at the top of the screen not even a little bit of it the whole damn thing The general incompetence continues throughout the film The whole production is bland and instantly forgettable The acting is poor throughout those three kids are very annoying and got on my nerves right from the start and made sitting through this film even more of a chore especially Curtis in his geeky over-sized glasses I just hate this film really simple as that I cant think of a single good thing to say about it Definitely one to avoid
This movie cannot be serious because it has a nerdy looking kid named Curtis killing people The other two psycho kids are kind of cute but that Curtis kid is just so ugly because he wears these huge brown ugly glasses The actor probably wandered on the wrong set and he was really supposed to go to Revenge of the Nerdsbr br Another thing that I hate so much about this movie is that Curtis takes his sweet time shooting people I kept my finger on the fast forward button because he took too long and what was up with his voice? He sounded like he was fourteen and not ten Another thing I hated was that he kept smiling like an idiot and there was no point to thatbr br Then they put that annoying kid in the freezer and somehow he found a flashlight in there That didnt make any sense and neither did the music The music didnt fit any of the scenesbr br This movie is slow boring and a waste of time Watch a different movie on your birthday
A mean spirited repulsive horror film about 3 murderous children Susan Strasberg is totally wasted in a 5-minute cameo even though she receives star billing If your a Julie Brown fan youll want to check it out since shes naked in a couple of shots All othersavoid
Bloody Birthday is a totally rubbish slasher movie from beginning to end br br I found the acting to be pretty good considering the genre of movie and its obvious low budget I dont know what was going on with the cinematography but it looked ghastly Way too over-saturated Maybe this is a bad transfer to DVD or maybe it always looked like that I dont know br br There really are no redeeming qualities to speak of There are a few deaths but not really gory I wouldnt bother with it if I was you The best thing about the DVD was the 15 minute interview with producer Max Rosenberg who was very amusing and honest He didnt have anything good to say about director Ed Hunt and admits the movie was a failure but he would like to re-make it as he believes it has a decent plot However he died in 2004 so I guess it will be up to someone else to take on that challenge With the way things have been going in the last few years it wouldnt surprise me theres at least one re-make per week at the cinema these day It couldnt be any worse than the original I suppose but I couldnt care less whether it got re-made or not
When you make a film with a killer-kids premise there are two effective ways to approach it; you can either make it as realistic as possible creating believable characters and situations or you can make it as fun as possible by playing it for laughs (something which the makers of Silent Night Deadly Night did for example on an equally controversial subject: a killer Santa) The people who made Bloody Birthday however do neither of those things; they simply rely on the shock value of the image of a kid with a gun (or a knife or a noose or an arrow) in hisher hand The result is both offensive and stupid The whole film looks like a bad idea that was rushed through production (and then kept from release for several years) Its redeemed a tiny bit by good performances from the kids but its VERY sloppily made (12)
When people say children are annoying u think ya my little cousins can be annoying and i said LITTLE These children are turning 10 and they are without a doubt the most annoying bratty children you will ever encounter (in a film) Lets start with the blonde - Debbie - Shes a slut of a girl i mean come on she wears mini skirts she has stupid frizzy blonde hair and a freckley red bunny like face She acts so innocent Next we have the second child - the Geek - who thinks hes so cool with his long range shooting and his use of a silencer (a coat over the gun) and most of all his evil bratty smile The next kid is the quiet one you dont care about so thats all on him This film angered me at the childrens intelligence and the only enjoyment i got was from my cousin who kept bitching about them
Bloody Birthday is an odd and at times humorous low-budget horror flick along the lines of Mikey or a less intelligent version of The Good Sonbr br Set in a small Californian town three babies are born at the height of an eclipse where planetary alignment means they are somehow born without emotions Ten years later our three little psychopaths take themselves on a killing spree doing away with parents siblings teachers and anyone else who irritates them Only one teenage girl knows the truth to be able to stop them There is no explanation for why babies across the world born at the same time arent equally as twisted but there you go!br br For a slasher film its very tame in terms of violence and gore which I suppose highlights the problem of casting child characters as the killers as there is only so much you can expose the young actors to Instead its amusing and a little disturbing seeing three ten-year-olds plotting murders and carrying out their plans using guns knives and crossbows The main reason why it doesnt descend into being totally ridiculous is because the child actors are very convincing in their roles with the way they slyly play the little innocents in front of undiscerning adults while showing their dark side to the girl who knows the truthbr br Bloody Birthday is rather mediocre as a horror flick with few scares and little blood but because it has the shock factor of having kids as the killers it is a bit unique in that way One to watch if theres nothing else on
Is it a poorly acted cliche-ridden pile of trash? Of course Anyone who doesnt realize that when they pick up the box in the video store probably doesnt have any right judging movies in the first place Thus I will now rate the aspects of the film that we actually care about on a scale of 1 to 10:br br Violence and gore: 4 -- For this genre there are very few deaths and the gore is almost non-existent Anyone looking for a little blood should probably look elsewhere The only redeeming quality is the fact that kids are doing these awful things which raises the bar a littlebr br Suspense: 1 -- Okay I feel bad for anyone who gets scared by this trio of dorky looking kidsbr br Nuditysex: 7 -- Lots of boobage from three different women one of whom is the MTV vj Julie Brown There are two sex scenes but little is shown in thembr br Unintentional humor -- 4 -- There are a few good laughs with the kids trying to act scary but all in all its just bad not funny badbr br Overall -- 4 -- Its not unwatchable There are a few fun moments and enough nudity to keep your attention for the entire movie However only watch this movie if youre a big fan of the 80s slasher flicks This definitely falls on the lower end of the scale but its not all the way at the bottom The real downside is the disappointing ending It almost ruined the movie for me
Formulaic slasher film only this one stars three ten year olds (all born during a lunar eclipse) as the killers Nice huh? A little bit of gore and a nice nude scene may make this worthwhile for diehard fans of the genre others bewarebr br 12 out of 
Cover Girl is a lacklustre WWII musical with absolutely nothing memorable about it save for its signature song Long Ago and Far Away This film came out before Gene Kelly really hit his artistic stride and while there are evidences of his burgeoning talent here mostly he plays sidekick to Rita Hayworth And theres the problem Rita Hayworth is gorgeous no doubt about that But shes simply not a compelling screen presence Ive always found myself wanting to like her more than I actually do and this movie is no exception Shes simply not a very good actress and shes not even a very good dancer Good looking as she is theres something vapid about her and this movie suffers because of itbr br Grade: C-
Rita Hayworth plays a Brooklyn nightclub dancer named Rusty who specializes in cheesecake chorus revues; she manages to get herself on the cover of a national fashion magazine but her impending success as a solo (with romantic offers all around) has smitten boss Gene Kelly chomping at the bit Terribly tired piece of Technicolor cotton candy with unmemorable musical sketches (the two worst of which are irrelevant flashbacks to the 1890s with Hayworth portraying her own grandmother) Kelly as always dances well but acts with false sincerity; when hes serious hes insufferable and the rest of the time hes flying on adrenaline The script is a lead weight not even giving supporting players Phil Silvers and Eve Arden any good lines 12 from 
Like Singin in the Rain Cover Girl has a trio of two guys and a girl In Cover Girl Phil Silvers (Genius) is the comic relief He corresponds to Donald OConnors funny man part in Singin in the Rain In Cover Girl Gene Kellys love interest is Rita Hayworth and in Rain its Debbie Reynolds Thats where the comparison endsbr br Whereas Singin in the Rain is a classic American movie musical Cover Girl is mediocrity incarnate The story isnt very complicated Rusty Parker (Rita Hayworth) is a dancer in Danny MacGuires low-rent nightclub in Brooklyn Rusty decides to enter a Cover Girl contest sponsored by a wealthy publisher John Coudair who made an unsuccessful play for Rustys grandmother years ago Coudair introduces Rusty to Broadway producer Noel Wheaton who makes her into a star Danny feels slighted when Rusty starts showing up late for rehearsals at the nightclub and decides to close the club down and go on the road entertaining the troops along with his sidekick Genius At the last minute with Rusty at the altar with Noel she realizes the error of her ways and runs back to Danny They live happily ever afterbr br Gene Kelly has the least developed part in the movie All we find out about him is that he owns a nightclub and is madly in love with Rusty Coudair and Wheaton act like besotted teenagers toward Rusty and Phil Silvers delivers some thoroughly goofy but unfunny shtick The most interesting aspect of Rita Hayworths performance is the scene in which she gets drunk This foreshadows what happened to her in real life Anyone who has read her biography will learn that she disliked Hollywood pined away for a normal home life which she could never attain but eventually began drinking and ended up with full-blown Alzheimers during the last years of her lifebr br Almost all of the songs in Cover Girl are old-fashioned and not very tuneful Gene Kelly has only one really excellent dance number and thats the scene where he dances with his alter ego Earlier the trio has another number which is a pale precursor of Make em Laugh from Singin in the Rainbr br The most annoying thing about Cover Girl is the way in which Rita Hayworth is put up on a pedestal A couple of decades later Raquel Welch had the same problem Both actresses later in their careers would always try and find scripts that showcased their acting abilities They wanted to be known as actresses and not pinup girls Unfortunately Cover Girl is an example of how Hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain
Rita Hayworth is just stunning at times and for me the only reason to watch this silly film Despite the overdone 1940s lipstick Rita was one of the all-time glamor women of Hollywood In fact for a couple of years I cant imagine anyone that looked better except maybe Elizabeth Taylor in her primebr br Anyway the co-star of the show Gene Kelly does not play his normal likable at least the kind of guy we all know him from in Singin In The Rain Here Kellys Danny McGuire pouts much of the time Phil Silvers who I loved on TV at Sgt Bilko is so stupid in here as Genius you will just cringe listening to his dumb jokesand they are stupidbr br The visuals are good with great Technicolor which almost looks terrific You get to see a lot of pretty women in here too not just Hayworth Unfortunately the story isnt all that much It centers around Hayworth deciding about a career choice Along the way we get the normal shabby treatment of marriage and we get an insultingly-dumb ending All in all an unmemorable film except as a showcase for Hayworths beauty
It hurt to watch this movie it really did I wanted to like it even going in Shot obviously for very little cash I looked past and told myself to appreciate the inspiration Unfortunately although I did appreciate the film on that level the acting and editing was terrible and the last 25-30 minutes were severe thumb-twiddling territory A 95 minute film should not drag The ratings for this one are good so far but I fear that the friends and family might have had a say in that one What was with those transitions? Dear Mr Editor did you just purchase your first copy of Adobe Premiere and make it your main goal to use all the goofy transitions that come with that silly program? Anyway some better actors a little more passion and some more appealing editing and this makes a decent movie
This film seems well made and more efforts should be made to promote films by women That aside this film is also profoundly disturbing in that it justifies the manipulative and psychotic machinations of a character that is profoundly disturbed If youve seen any of the promotional material you might think this is a poignant film about a relationship thats reached its end but none of that suggests how really disturbing the central premise is:br br A woman threatens suicide unless her soon to be ex agrees to relive here most treasured memories of their relationship When told how unfair (to say the least) that such a threat is Tessa (the purported protagonist) suggests that lifes not fairbr br Huh??? This character also uses tears to manipulate her former lover into staying and coaxes him into sexually oriented behavior (which she initially denies as a motive) all the while assuring him this isnt sexbr br Reverse the genders have the leads played by Tracey Gold and Brian Austin-Green and this could air in feature length on Lifetime with a title like Hostage to Obsession There is no medically accepted definition of sound mental and emotional stability that would encompass Tessas behavior in this filmbr br Props to Kristen Thomson for playing a border-line psychotic manipulative ex to a T perhaps too well because there is no well-adjusted person male or female who could watch this and not have shivers run up their spine
Sorry but Jacqueline Hyde (get it??? - Jack L and Hyde - Jekyll & Hyde) has some of the worst acting this side of hardcore porn not to mention a script apparently written by a first-grader with undiagnosed learning disabilitiesbr br Jackie Hyde inherits an old mansion by a grandfather she never knew she had Guess who? Yes an inventor of the special formula that slowly takes over ones body and mind - yes that Mr Hyde! br br Despite some nice skin scenes this film fails to register any feeling or emotion other than uncontrollable laughterbr br As much as poor Jackie tries she just cant stay away from granddaddys special formula and the result is an hour and half of wasted time
Jacqueline Hyde starts like any other normal day for telemarketing individual Jackie Hyde (co-producer Gabriella Hall) until her boss (Robert Donovan) fires her for taking personal calls at work however its not all bad news as the call she took was from a lawyer informing her that her Grandfather (Malcolm Bennett) has recently died & that he left her his mansion & fortune (why doesnt stuff like that ever happen to me? Sigh) Very excited Jackie heads on over there & makes herself right at home while looking for the thermostat late one night Jackie stumbles upon a secret room where her Grandfather stashes the bright red formula that he invented that allows whoever drinks it to change their appearance Being a bit on the porky side Jackie finally settles on the glamorous Jacqueline (Blythe Metz) however Jackies better looking alter-ego starts to take controlbr br Written co-produced & directed by Rolfe Kanefsky I thought Jacqueline Hyde was complete total & utter crap from start to finish & its as simple & straight forward as that According to the opening credits Jacqueline Hyde was inspired by the classic Robert Louis Stevenson novel The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde frankly if Mr Stevenson could see what was being done to his story here hed turn in his grave For a start I think Jacqueline Hyde wasis intended to be a horror film the IMDb certainly lists it as such but there isnt any horror in it at all apart from just how bad it is I would say that Jacqueline Hyde is more a soft-core porno than anything else & extremely tame with it why sit down & watch this softer than soft porno crap when you can watch you proper hard-core stuff that actually delivers the goods? Why thats the question I ask here Its not even good porn either besides being far too soft its dull boring & the not-worth-mentioning sex scenes are few & far between The most intelligent aspect of this film is the title which would have been quite clever if not for the fact that another film used the Jacqueline Hyde (1998) title during the last century & judging by the IMDbs plot summary it sounds a hell of a lot better than this piece of rubbish This is one of those films you have to watch yourself to see just how bad it is but just hope that you never get the opportunitybr br Director Kanefsky was obviously working on a low budget but thats not an excuse these days shot on a digital camcorder the film looks cheap & the few instances of CGI look like they came from a Nintendo Gameboy the final shocking twist has probably the worst morph effect Ive ever seen & is pretty good for a laugh as is the scene when Jackies breasts grow via more terrible CGI Thats another thing the film takes itself far too seriously The subject matter sucks is far too predictable & makes for a poor film but maybe if the dialogue had been intentionally funny with some dirty porn talk the film might have been more fun to watch alas it isnt so it isnt Forget about any decent horror violence or gore as there isnt any apart from a surprisingly bloodless decapitation at the endbr br Technically Jacqueline Hyde is home made film type stuff the photography is of the flat hand held point-&-shoot variety the music production design & special effects are of a suitably low standard to match the script The acting was awful seriously this is badbr br Jacqueline Hyde in my opinion a load of crap there is not one positive thing about this turgid film that I can think of Any proper film lover will have an almost impossible time trying to find any redeeming value in this crap definitely one to avoid
Maniratnam who in India is often compared with prominent world film makers and is regarded a genius in film-making has yet again proved that he can only make the frames look visually good without offering much food for thoughtForget about pure cinematic pleasure that can be derived from cinema as a very old form of artbr br While I would not like to claim and portray myself as someone who has seen all the beautiful movies made around the world still any thoughtful and a bit educated film goer can identify that his films do not contain innovative ingenuous plots does not contain lingering effects afterward and MOSTLY contain ridiculous ending and a LOT of melodrama seen profusely in Indian moviesbr br Overall Maniratnam has successfully confirmed my distaste for his films once againbr br Sorry for those who on this board were claiming otherwise My suggestion to you: WATCH SOME BEAUTIFUL CINEMAS MADE AROUND THE GLOBE
This film which I rented under the title Black Voodoo should be avoided I was expecting a blaxploitationhorror flick; but what I got was a very dull standard ghost extracts vegence In this case the ghost was that of a religious cult leader who tried to refuse treatment but whos plea was ignored and he died in an operation The result: his spirit posesses Nurse Sherry and forces her to commit acts of murder The only voodoo connection was to one of the three black characters in this case a blinded ex-football player whos mom practiced voodoo The film is very slow and very dull There is a very standard ending that provides on excitement followed by a horrificly stupid ending (warning: SPOILER)br br In which a woman actually manages to defend herself against murder charges by saying she was possessed This movie is slow and bad in a non-funny just stupefying way Avoid it at all costs
The first 20 minutes were a little fun because I dont think Ive seen a film this bad before {acting script effects (!) etc} The rest of the running time seemed to drag forever with every cliche in dialog used to no effect These people seemed to not really like horror movies or how to make them or any other movie Theres no adult language a bit of brief nudity and no gore except fake blood smeared over no open wounds etc It would have been rated PG in the early eighties and PG-13 nowadays Im not sure how it got an R rating or if it really did I saw the American International release titled Hospital Of Terror Ive seen 100 horror films in the past 12 months and this is probably the worst film Ive ever seen Heres an example of how bad it is: Theres one scene where something green comes through the door Im not sure what its supposed to be but what it is on screen is some kids green crayon scribblings {Im not exaggerating} super-imposed over the film semi-moving inside the door then its supposed to do something to Nurse Sherri to possess her I suppose I could not believe they had the lack of pride to show this embarrassment
I only came here to check Terror Hospital for an alternate title so Id know what not to pick up Not only do I get the original title but I come to find Terror Hospital is one of seven more aliasesThis one is a real clunker Movies like this can usually be forgiven for any number of reasons mostly unintended consequences of the feature on every level of production that result in at least a mild form of entertainment mostly amusement This has none of that Instead the viewer is witness to redundantly unnecessary and way-too-convenient-for-the-situation exposition and drawn out scenes of characters warily moving from room to room and all this is half of the film Forget trying to figure out where anybody is (or who they are) during darkened or nighttime scenes too; you probably wont care anyway There is also a random car chase sequence that seems quite dull when compared to some of the old drivers ed movies I slep er I mean sat through and watched way back in high school Really were talking about mysticism possession and a killer on the loose here - not a bad recipe for trash cinema Unfortunately theres nothing here to make it even good trash; when joined to the aforementioned the bad acting and not-so-special effects are just that - bad acting and not-so-special effects This ones just trash pure and simple Leave it on the rack at the pawn shop or in that box at the yard sale Theres a reason its there
This is a hard film to rate While it truly deserves its 3 (or perhaps even a two) for an Al Adamson film its exceptional--and practically Adamsons very best Thats because unlike many Adamson films there are times when NURSE SHERRI almost looks competent But being an Adamson film you know that sooner or later that crappiness MUST rear its ugly head! br br The film begins with some bizarre cult leader of a huge congregation (six) trying to resurrect a dead guy who looks like hes made of blue cheese However in the process the cult dude has a heart attack and it taken to the hospital He apparently dies but it also seems like many of these hospital scenes are missing and a few of them appear much later in the film In other words when you see the film he appears to have possibly recovered--only to hear later that hed died Because the guy is the bff of Satan however his evil soul cant die and he comes back to both haunt one of his henchmen and to possess Nurse Sherribr br Now Sherri is obviously a very disturbed lady--demonic possession or not At times she acts like a zombie and at others shes violently homicidal So I askwhy didnt her boyfriend (a doctor) think this was perhaps problematic?! In other words after trying to kill a patient he neither gets an exorcist nor commits her to the booby hatch!!! Oh and speaking of boobiesthis movie is NOT the breast-filled sex romp its title and posters would indicate While there are a few bare breasts here and there they are irrelevant to the plot and only seen very briefly (12 second or so) in all but one scene So if you are a perv this movie is not for you--though a few places in the film (such as the nurse undressing for a patient) make it look like the film MIGHT have at one time been designed as a porn flickbr br If you are a bad movie fan however there is enough to whet your appetite Some examples of incompetence are the inability of many of the actors to deliver lines that arent zombie-like--and I am not even talking about Sherri Especially noticeable is one of the very final scenes--I have never seen and heard some stilted acting and dialog in my life--and this includes Ed Woods films! There are also a few more cheap touches such as the bad animation of the green stuff the doctor finding a murdered nurse yet continuing to investigate in a house where walls are covered in blood (Id get a copbetter yet an army of cops)br br So despite these problems why do I think its good for an Adamson film? Well the story isnt all bad and he was able to build tension very well Many false alarms early on made my heart race a bit Also the car crash while irrelevant came off pretty well and was practically big-budget for Adamsonbr br Overall not a good film and one most people would be bored watching However fans of Adamson or inept films will like it--it does deliver some entertainment in a cheesy manner that will provide a few laughs
I bought this on VHS as Terror Hospital and when I got home I checked IMDb and was like OMG its the legendary Nurse Sherri!!! So heres another one from Al Adamson who had clearly learned some minuscule amount about film-making since the Blood of Draculas Castle days Where that earlier effort is a more or less totally sclerotic lump this one mixes it up a little adding a definite element of variety and surprise amid the incompetence Sure half of the movie is a blind post-op football player shooting the breeze with his stacked nurse but at any moment we might be cutting away to the cackling disembodied head of the satanist mastermind or Nurse Sherri running a farmer through with a pitchfork or a wee bit of abstract student-film quick cutting to go with the pulsing-blob effects in the possession scene or the most gratuitously half-hearted topless bit ever or god knows what else (I forget to be honest) As dumb-ass pieces of sht go this one runs toward the high end Congrats Al
The film opens with a cult leader attempting to resurrect a dead member with his followers chanting for his rebirth as the sun strikes upon them in the desert Reanhauer(Bill Roy)believes wholeheartedly in his power and gets so worked up that he collapses with what appeared to be a heart attack Unable to keep him alive all those involved doctors and nurses are sentenced for attack with Reanhauers demonic spirit invading the curvaceous body of nurse Sherri(big-chested Jill Jacobson)targeting each one using her as a tool of vengeance Forced against her will with no memory of inflicting such harm Sherris host body murders selected victims Fortunately Sherris fellow co-worker nurse Tara(Marilyn Joi)begins a rather blossoming romance with a blinded patient Marcus Washington(Prentiss Moulden) once a star football player whose mother was a practitioner of voodoo Through Marcus knowledge passed down from mom Tara finds out about possession and how to possibly save Sherri before she murders everyone unknowingly Meanwhile Sherris lover Dr Peter Desmond(Geoffrey Land)worries about her present condition and welfarebr br Well this was my first Al Adamson film and I must agree with his detractors that just from this film alone it seems he holds them together with paper clips and Elmers glue The animation with which we see the spirit take control of Sherri is beyond awful and rather laughable A little soft-core nonsense as filler some demonic possession thrown in the mix(Sherri actually speaks in another voice when shes possessed) with naughty nurse behavior(the three nurses focused on in the film all are quite sexually active and free-spirited)and a little bit violencegore The film is essentially shot in tiny rooms with dull dialogue from a rather mundane cast The sexual situations arent that hard-core and Al often shoots them without revealing all that much The film looks embarrassingly cheap and theres an absence of thrills although the chilling score(which sounds like something from Dark Shadows)does help a little bit Jacobson and Mary Kay Pass(as nurse Beth who seems to be a nymphomaniac if shell even screw a nutty patient always complaining of illnesses he really doesnt have with enough chest hair to declare him a Neanderthal)arent bad looking and Adamsons story-line although frail is somewhat coherent(it seems he rarely directs films which are) Overall the movie looks like it cost 5 bucks and Adamson just can not overcome the budgetary restrictions(or in my opinion create an unpleasant enough atmosphere due to a sometimes plodding narrative and tedious scenes which do little for the story) John F Goff has the role of the hospitals psychiatrist who wants to commit Sherri not believing the idea that she was possessed;he constantly bickers with Peter over her I watched the unrated lost version which I guess is the real version to watch of Nurse Sherri
Art-house horror tries to use unconventional aesthetics to cover the fact that this is just another serial killer chiller which ultimately relies on pornographic combinations of teen sexuality and violent gore The suburbs come across about as well as they do in every piece of Australian writing (book or film) since 1960 - surprise surprise the suburbs have a dark underbelly - and the plot is as contrived as any youve seen The neighbours would never know about this guy one of the filmmakers says about Joel Edgertons character But he was completely plausible as to what he was Serial killers dont all have patches over their eyes and scars down their cheeks They look like the guy next door Another trader in pornographic violence who sees a serial killer in every street But the real insignificance of this film is in the fact that its a genre film that nobody saw Backed by substantial funds (including some from Film Finance - thats government) this got a run at the Underground Film Festival in Melbourne and had to rely on ACMI kindness for a very short release season Q1: What is the FFC doing funding genre flicks even if they are arty and aesthetically unconventional? Q2: Why are these nasty movies (ACOLYTES; BEAUTIFUL; PUNISHMENT; NO THROUGH ROAD) being made in the first place? Richard Wolstencroft & co encourage their creators to believe theyre giving the masses what they really want as opposed to what the culture elite in government funding think they want The truth is that these brutal and forgettable nasties earn far more critical acclaim - and win far more obscure awards - than theyre due
I was completely bored with this film melodramatic for no apparent reason Every thing just becomes so serious and people are swearing with really dumb expressions Then there is a serial Killer who apparently can Kill one person to get the title of serial Killer Well the serial Killer likes butterflies and is illustrated by sound effects you might hear in the dream sequence of most modern films;br br why oh why? I nave no idea It really really wants to be scary but I think in this universe scary equals talk a whole bunch and add dark ambient noisesJust for the record this is in no way is a horror film its most definitely a thriller (barely) Really movie makers nowadays need to do their homework before making horror films or at least calling a movie a horror film it makes me say (in too may words ironically) acolytes you take forever to say nothing
A rather lame teen slasher from Brisbane While the plot hinges on a fairly decent idea the writing is profoundly lame and two of the three main teens are absurdly wooden The problem is that for the kids to go through with their plan they have to be far more reckless than shown but if they were that devil-may-care it would perhaps be hard for them to be likable so they end up being neither really In fact I only started enjoying the film when I started wishing for their death One of those movies where in about a thousand places the most sensible option would be to call the police I realise we wouldnt have a movie if they did but it would be nice if we could believe that they actually wouldnt Avoid
This was a decent movie for the first half Too many cheap BOO! moments but the tension builds the bad guys are creepy and everything seems to be setting itself up nicely The kids are not particularly deep but hey that works for teens br br Then it just gets ridiculous and tries way too hard- the why in the world would hethey do that? moments overwhelm anyones capacity for suspension of disbelief the twist involves too many ridiculous coincidences and the title comes from a late attempt to philosophize some meaning into the film that goes nowhere and is quickly dropped There was laughter in the theater at moments that were in no way supposed to be funny br br Great premise but just badly written and doesnt hold together Some very nice shots but theyre hard to enjoy while youre rolling your eyes
Acolytes presents an interesting mix of original concepts in screaming teen cliché horror with a more thriller-like pacing In some ways Acolytes is very successful but in many other ways the film fails miserablybr br Overall Acolytes avoided the typical archetypes of the naivety and innocence of youth of endless horror films in the like of Cabin Fever Texas Chainsaw Massacre and countless other films where unsuspecting and relatively naive and innocent teenagers have sex run around screaming and one-by-one are plucked off by some sort of monster Instead this innocence is replaced with pride retaliation and arrogance The characters had several opportunities to save themselves from immanent death and despair but failed to do so due to their own personal demons In the end you were left with the feeling that there were no (and perhaps are no) innocent victimsbr br As the name implies the film also touches greatly on following a leader or authority This was used in a direct sense of if the main character would become like the serial killer and was also used less directly throughout the film Following a central figure is a reoccurring theme throughout the filmbr br Through all this the film makers also incorporated a lot of cliché which I suspect was intentional and gave the film a unique mixture of depth as well as shallowness which I found intriguing This perhaps inadvertently plays well with the characters who are at first appearance very shallow but as the story unfolds it becomes obvious that they are at least the two main male characters quite complexbr br Technically the film has a lot of problems however The cinematography which is typically regarded highly I find rather sophomoric and over-stylized utilizing formulaic 23 approaches far too rigidly Many transitions I felt were also over-stylized The use of symbolism was not only vague but also greatly over usedbr br The plot was poorly planned and relied exclusively on misinformation in order to achieve a rather hokey twist ending which was poorly resolved and leaves viewers confused Methods used to resolve the climax are cheap and ill-prepared motivations are routinely unclear and major plot points remain untied in the endbr br Overall the films relative originality themes and thesis are lost in a maze of poor technical execution over-stylized imagery unclear motives obtuse and unnecessary symbolism and cheap twists maintained only by a lack of or entirely incorrect informationbr br If the film were better executed it would have been excellent However Acolytes receives only two stars in my opinion
I caught this on IFC last week and I thought it was typical of the indie short subject film: heavy on style little on substance and originality Does it comes as any surprise that a coming out film stars an unusually attractive (and blond to boot) boy with 70s shag hair and too-cool-for-school clothes? Plus this film wallows in late 1970s chic which works for some (Sofia Coppolas The Virgin Suicides comes to mind) but not for this directorbr br Another reviewer compared this to Harmony Korines work and I agree Yet I dont view this as a positive thing (what has HE done lately anyway?) Bobbycrush is really just a waste of time and energy for all involved If you happen to see it late night on cable turn the channel and watch something else instead
Its Saturday its raining and I think every movie should have at least one comment so I just watched The Crime Doctors Courage all the way through Its a murder mystery with a typical cast of characters and a couple of the usual suspects -- each with their own possible motive for the crime The story starts abruptly and the viewer is thrown into the plot with no character development or storytelling whatsoever I guess thats not too surprising for a B movie of this period There are also some moments which look and feel like this is pre-WWII but perhaps that is due to the writers background in radio showsbr br The Crime Doctor is the sleuth who happens to be visiting California for some R&R from his psychiatry practice on the East coast He hooks up with a mystery novelist friend with whom it is implied has been along for one or more previous mystery solving capers The novelist occasionally fills the role of sidekick to our sleuth (AKA Dr Watson) and also occasionally lightens things up with a bit of comic relief (sort of)br br There is also a somewhat simple but not quite bumbling police captain who at times is annoyed by the meddling sleuth And then there are the mysterious Braggas a brother and sister who are dance artists at a night-club The dance is sort of an interpretive dance that happens to be one of those moments which feels more like the 30s than the 40s Though the story location is California the Braggas appear to live in a castle!br br There was one plot element which managed to keep me somewhat amused but I wont divulge any more than that because I always enjoy movies more when the story is discovered rather than known in advance (even though I can think of many many B films which would rate higher and it is difficult to say that watching this one is time well spent) I have not seen any other movies from the Crime Doctor series so I cant make any comparisons
Frightmare begins with a horror movie icon killing a director and then his servant before he is laid to rest This icon who has some Christopher Lee qualities to him then continues to haunt those around him when a group of horror film society students steal his corpse from the mausoleum he is inbr br The first ten minutes is well-filmed good writing and lots of potential for murderous mayhem But the film drags in the middle (although thankfully not as much as House of Death) and never really gets that initial spurt of energy backbr br Lots of the deaths are confusing as they seem to have people just falling over scared when they see a floating coffin or other odd things Twice we see poisonous gas being used But the box promises that this horror star will be the embodiment of all the monsters he has played Boy is that false advertising unless he spent his career playing boring old men who take naps and watch Matlockbr br The general principle of the film is decent: horror society kids stealing a corpse of a dead icon A modern equivalent (digging up Vincent Price or Peter Cushing) would make a great film Maybe a remake is in order if that wouldnt be too disrespectful Sometimes theory doesnt come across as well in application and this film offers that examplebr br The only redeeming quality of this film (besides the beginning) is the brief appearance of a very young Jeffrey Combs I saw him and thought thats Jeffrey Combs but felt I was mistaken as the box never mentioned him But sure enough Combs was present (A note to this movies film-makers: mention Combs on the cover of the DVD youll sell more copies if if you would be deceiving customers) If youre a Jeffrey Combs die-hard check out this early role Otherwise I cannot offer this as a great selection for a horror movie marathon Let me suggest Intruder or Popcorn as those are both pretty decent and will stand the test of time
My parents used to rent a lot of horror movies when I was a child We loved watching them even when they were bad they made for some enjoyment This was one such movie kind of hard to review as I have only seen it the one time as a child but it is not anything I want to track down again so I can do a more in-depth review The story has some old horror actor legend dying I seem to remember he acted a bit like an over the top Vincent Price without being likable and classy He commits murders and dies but what is this? Is the movie over already? No as some kids for some reason snag the body and are prepared for a fun night of being killed by the ham from beyond the grave I remember the murders were nothing all that special after the first couple and I remember this movie was rather disappointing Seemed to have a good premise but it just failed to deliver the goods as more cool kills were needed and that super horror actor needed to add a bit to his repertoire
One of the last surviving horror screen greats - Conrad Radzoff - dies and has his body placed in a mausoleum with televised-before-death snippets of the great Conrad greeting you as you visit Unfortunately for him and his captors Conrads body is borrowed by a gang of four boys and three girls and taken to a huge manor where they drink with him toast him dance with him laugh with and at him and then put him to bed in a casket which just happens to by lying in a room upstairs News of the missing body reaches Radzoffs widow and her friend(who happens to be proficient in the black arts) and she holds some kind of ceremony that brings Conrad back to life so he can in his own words get an eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth Well Frightmare is an interesting bad film Sure it is cheap The sets look like they were borrowed(which I am sure they were) The special effects and blood and guts are done liberally and with little credibility The acting is average to below average with a few exceptions Jeffrey Combs of Re-Animator fame is in tow but really he does little in this rather thankless role as a horror obsessed teen that needs to steal a dead mans body for kicks None of the kids except the pretty girl playing Meg is any good Nita Talbot plays the friend of the Radzoffs with withering interest Also look for the big - I mean big - guy that plays the policeman That is Porky himself of Porkys fame But thankfully for all of us one performance does rise above the material Ferdy Mayne an oft overlooked actor from Germany who had Christopher Lee features and did star as a vampire in The Fearless Vampire Killers does a more than commendable job as the aging horror icon in public life and a real demon of a man in private life Conrad Radzoff in a bad human being in life living solely for his own pleasures and we see him kill twice before he is even dead(obviously none of the swinging teens at that point) Mayne is able to look very regal speak very elegantly and convey menace with ease If for no other reason one should see Frightmare for his performance I do; however believe that when they showed black and white clips of Radzoff that they used Christopher Lee footage(anyone have any thoughts?) Anyway one can guess what happens and it does indeed: Radzoff goes out and goes after the kids that disturbed his peace Again the formula is trite and overused The acting for the most part is anemic and the direction oh so ridiculous But Mayne gives a good performance in a sea of ineptitude Definitely worth a little peek Watching Mayne keep popping up on screens in his mausoleum brought a wry smile to my lips each time
Conrad Radzoff(Ferdy Mayne) a hammy cult icon dies from a heart ailment(not before disposing of an ungrateful assistant and TV commercial director both of whom disrespected him with showers of insults) His body is removed from his mausoleum by some film students(they wish to invite him to dinnerthey are quite big fans) What these kids(including a young Jeffrey Combs)dont expect is that Radzoff will be resurrected by a medium to wreak havoc on those who removed him from his place of restbr br The list of violent acts include Radzoff pulling one guys tongue out setting a woman on fire elevating a casket which crushes a womans face decapitates one fellow and cremates another guy alive in a coffin A really weird soundtrack and pesky fog wraps around Radzoffs ghoulish activitiesbr br Silly hokum from Troma is limited by a very very low budget and slowwwwww pace The film feels a lot longer than it is The film isnt really that gory and we can hardly see much violence because the film is often too damn dark At times Radzoff is an ominous presence yet at other times he just looks real silly
Once again Mr Costner has dragged out a movie for far longer than necessary Aside from the terrific sea rescue sequences of which there are very few I just did not care about any of the characters Most of us have ghosts in the closet and Costners character are realized early on and then forgotten until much later by which time I did not care The character we should really care about is a very cocky overconfident Ashton Kutcher The problem is he comes off as kid who thinks hes better than anyone else around him and shows no signs of a cluttered closet His only obstacle appears to be winning over Costner Finally when we are well past the half way point of this stinker Costner tells us all about Kutchers ghosts We are told why Kutcher is driven to be the best with no prior inkling or foreshadowing No magic here it was all I could do to keep from turning it off an hour in
This is a pale imitation of Officer and a Gentleman There is NO chemistry between Kutcher and the unknown woman who plays his love interest The dialog is wooden the situations hackneyed Its too long and the climax is anti-climactic(!) I love the USCG its men and women are fearless and tough The action scenes are awesome but this movie doesnt do much for recruiting I fear The script is formulaic but confusing Kutchers character is trying to redeem himself for an accident that wasnt his fault? Costners is raging against the dying of the light but why? His conflict with his wife is about as deep as a mud puddle I saw this sneak preview for free and certainly felt I got my moneys worth
It seems ever since 1982 about every two or three years we get a movie that claims to be The Next Officer and a Gentleman There has yet to be one movie that has lived up to this claim and this movie is no differentbr br We get the usual ripped off scenes from OAAG (I want you DOR the instructor gives the Richard Gere character his overdose of drills in hopes hell quit the Gere character comes back for the girl the Gere character realizes the instructor is great etc) and this movie is as predictable as the sun rising in the East and is horribly miscast on top Costner plays his usual wise teacher character the only character he can play and you really get a sense of his limited acting abilities here Kutcher is terrible in the Richard Gere character just miscast with acting skills barely a notch above Keanu Reevesbr br The main problem with this OAAG wannabe is the two main characters are so amazingly one-dimensional you never care for either in the least and when Kutchers character finally turns around (just like Gere did in OAAG) you just go so what? The movie leaves no plot point unturned and seems to never end as if to say oh wait we forgot to close out the girlfriend story or the what happens after he graduates story or the other six plot points in the movie Whats more baffling is the great reviews I see here The general publics opinions never cease to amaze me
Wow another Kevin Costner hero movie Postman Tin Cup Waterworld Bodyguard Wyatt Earp Robin Hood even that baseball movie Seems like he makes movies specifically to be the center of attention The characters are almost always the same  the heroics the flaws the greatness the fall the redemption Yup within the 1st 5 minutes of the movie were all supposed to be in awe of his character and it builds up more and more from therebr br And this time the story  story?  is just a collage of different movies You dont need a spoiler; youve seen this movie several times though it had different titles Youll know what will happen way before it happens This is like mixing An Officer and a Gentleman with Backdraft but both are easily better movies Watch Backdraft to see how this kind of movie should be made  and also to see how an good but slightly underrated actor Russell plays the hero
Alas another Costner movie that was an hour too long Credible performances but the script had no where to go and was in no hurry to get there First we are offered an unrelated string of events few of which further the story Will the script center on Randall and his wife? Randall and Fischer? How about Fischer and Thomas? In the end no real front story ever develops and the characters themselves are artificially propped up by monologues from third parties The singer explains Randall Randall explains Fischer on and on Finally long after you dont care anymore you will learn something about the script meetings Three endings were no doubt proffered and no one could make a decision The end result? All three were used one after another after another If you can hang in past the 100th yawn youll be able to pick them out Despite the transparent attempt to gain points with a dedication to the Coast Guard this one should have washed out the very first day
I wish I knew what to make of a movie like this It seems to be divided into two parts -- action sequences and personal dramas ashore It follows Ashton Kutsher through survival swimmer school guided by Master Chief Kevin Costner then to Alaska where a couple of spectacular rescues take place the last resulting in deathbr br I must say that the scenes on the beach struck me as so stereotypical in so many ways that they should be barnacle encrusted A typical bar room fight between Navy guys and Coast Guardsmen (puddle pirates) The experienced old timer Costner who is as an elderly bar tender tells him married to the Coast Guard The older chief who keeps trying to prove to himself that hes still nineteen The neglected ex wife ashore to whom Kostner pays a farewell visit The seemingly sadistic demands placed on the swimmers by the instructors all in pursuit of a loftier goal The gifted young man hobbled by a troubled pastbr br The problem is that weve seen it all before If its Kevin Costner here its Clint Eastwood or John Wayne or Lou Gosset Jr or Vigo Mortenson or Robert DeNiro elsewhere And the climactic scene has elements drawn shamelessly from The Perfect Storm and Dead Calm None of it is fresh and none of the old stereotyped characters and situations are handled with any originalitybr br It works best as a kind of documentary of what goes on in the swimmers school and what could happen afterward and even thats a little weak because we dont get much in the way of instruction Its mostly personal conflict romance and tension about washing outbr br Its a shame because the U S Coast Guard is rather a noble outfit its official mission being the safety of lives and property at sea In war time it is transferred to the Navy Department and serves in combat roles In World War II the Coast Guard even managed to have a Medal of Honor winner in its ranksbr br But again we dont learn much about that We dont really learn much about anything The film devolves into a succession of visual displays and not too much else A disappointment
A tough sell: British playwright Ronald Harwood adapts his autobiographical stage drama into loud bellowing film about WWII Shakespearean theatrical troupe saddled with an aged blustery brilliant-but-unreliable star at the end of his tether The actors effete assistant works diligently to get his master coiffed and costumed for a production of King Lear (during an Air Raid!) yet both men are losing their grip on their unraveling situation Based on the waning years of actor Donald Wolfit whose dresser was Ronald Harwood this acclaimed production would seem to be a welcome haven for scenery-chewing thespians Unfortunately Albert Finney (at this point in his career not at all elderly) seems too robust and quick-thinking to play the actor; Finney (and Oscar-nominated director Peter Yates) cannot modulate Sirs moods and bouts of coherency in a way that makes sense to us so that in one scene hes stopping a train with the commanding echo of his voice and in the next hes curiously falling apart With such a wreck of a human being in the midst of failing health and aptitude one would assume a dedicated assistant would go to great lengths to protect his boss (and his future) yet servant Tom Courtenay prods and badgers and goads Finney to carry on rather than rest Courtenay who played this part on stage (and was nominated for an Oscar alongside Finney for Best Actor) is far more attuned to his role and eventually his bleating commands and confusion achieve the only real feeling in the film These two thankfully do not peck at each others heads and scenarist Harwood is careful not to fall into a love-hate pattern (which could possibly be perceived in the films first act); but without a juxtaposition of servant vs celebrity theres nothing much to behold in this portrait except for the deterioration of narcissism the hint at what once was 12 from 
Blake Edwards legendary fiasco begins to seem pointless after just 10 minutes A combination of The Eagle Has Landed Star! Oh! What a Lovely War! and Edwards Pink Panther films Darling Lili never engages the viewer; the aerial sequences the musical numbers the romance the comedy and the espionage are all ho hum At what point is the viewer supposed to give a damn? This disaster wavers in tone never decides what it wants to be and apparently thinks its a spoof but its pathetically and grindingly square Old fashioned in the worst sense audiences understandably stayed away in droves Its awful James Garner would have been a vast improvement over Hudson who is just cardboard and he doesnt connect with Andrews and vice versa And both Andrews and Hudson dont seem to have been let in on the joke and perform with a miscalculated earnestness Blake Edwards SOB isnt much more than OK but its the only good that ever came out of Darling Lili The expensive and professional look of much of Darling Lili only make what its all lavished on even more difficult to bear To quote Paramount chief Robert Evans 24 million dollars worth of film and no picture
Im not a big fan of musicals although this technically might not qualify as a musical But I thought I would give it a chance as I love war movies It was mediocre at bestbr br Hudson seems totally out of kilter in this role It just didnt work for me Julie Andrews probably played her part as best as she could but I just find it hard to buy her as a conniving deceptive spy Sorry I know that is classic stereotyping on my part But I have to say I think this is Julie at her most beautiful and feminine looking I always thought of her as more matronly but then surely thats a result of her roles in Sound of Music and Mary Poppins No doubt they were desperately trying to get her out of that typecasting in this role She was quite beguiling in appearance here but I still didnt buy her as a spybr br I couldnt keep my focus through the whole movie and found myself tuning in and out - and having conversations with those in my room (which I usually never do - Im always shushing everybody) So that tells you how little it held my attention Dont waste your time!
David Bryces comments nearby are exceptionally well written and informative as almost say everything I feel about DARLING LILI This massive musical is so peculiar and over blown over produced and must have caused ruptures at Paramount in 1970 It cost 22 million dollars! That is simply irresponsible DARLING LILI must have been greenlit from a board meeting that said hey we got that Pink Panther guy and that Sound Of Music gal lets get this too and handed over a blank cheque The result is a hybrid of GIGI ZEPPELIN HALF A SIXPENCE some MGM 40s song and dance numbers of a style (daisies and boaters!) so hopelessly old fashioned as to be like musical porridge and MATA HARI dramatics The production is colossal lush breathtaking to view but the rest: the ridiculous romance Julie looking befuddled Hudson already dead the mistimed comedy and the astoundingly boring songs deaden this spectacular film into being irritating LILI is like a twee 1940s mega musical with some vulgar bits to spice it up STAR! released the year before sadly crashed and now is being finally appreciated for the excellent film is genuinely is and Andrews looks sublime mature especially in the last half hourbut LILI is POPPINS and DOLLY frilly and I believe really killed off the mega musical binge of the 60s and made Andrews look like Poppins again which I believe was not Edwards intention Paramount must have collectively fainted when they saw this: and with another $20 million festering in CATCH 22 and $12 million in ON A CLEAR DAY and $25 million in PAINT YOUR WAGONthey had a financial abyss of CLEOPATRA proportions with $77 million tied into 4 films with very uncertain futures Maybe they should have asked seer Daisy Gamble from ON A CLEAR DAY LILI was very popular on immediate first release in Australia and ran in 70mm cinemas for months but it failed once out in the subs and the sticks and only ever surfaced after that on one night stands with ON A CLEAR DAY as a Sunday night double Thank god Paramount had their simple $1million (yes ONE MILLION DOLLAR) film LOVE STORY and that $4 million dollar gangster pic THE GODFATHER also ready to recover all the $77 million in just the next two yearsfor just $5m incredible!
Years ago when DARLING LILI played on TV it was always the pan and scan version which I hated and decided to wait and see the film in its proper widescreen format So when I saw an inexpensive DVD of this Julie AndrewsBlake Edwards opus I decided to purchase and watch it once and for allbr br Boy what a terrible film Its so bad and on so many levels that I really do not know where to start in describing where and when it goes so horribly wrong Looking at it now its obvious to any fans of movies that Blake Edwards created this star vehicle for his wife simply because so many other directors had struck gold with Andrews in musicals (MARY POPPINS SOUND OF MUSIC THOROUGHLY MODERN MILLIE etc) but also because Andrews was snubbed from starring in projects made famous on stage by Julie herself (CAMELOT MY FAIR LADY etc) because Hollywood thought she wasnt sexy or glamorous enough So Blake created this stillborn effort to showcase his wife in a bizarre concoction of spy storywar movieromanceslapstick comedymusical DARLING LILI suffers from multiple personalities never knowing who or what it is Some specific scenes are good or effective but as a whole it just doesnt work at all to a point of it being very embarrassingbr br Mind you the version on the DVD is the directors cut or in this case lets salvage whatever we can from this notorious box office flop In releasing the DVD Edwards cut 19 scenes (19!!!!!!!!) from the original bloated theatrical version into this more streamlined and yet remarkably ineffective version The film moves along with no idea of what it is We are 25 minutes into it and we still dont know whats going on or why were watching whats going What kind of spy is Lili? How powerful is she? Was she ever responsible for someones death? Instead we watch a thoroughly bored looking Rock Hudson trying to woo a thoroughly bored looking Julie Andrews Things arent helped much with the inexplicable reason why the two fall in love Why does Julie fall for Hudson? Why him and not other men she got involved with? There should have been one of her ex hanging around trying to win her back or trying to decipher her secret This would have given us some much needed contrast to the muddled action It would also have given us some impetuous to the sluggish proceedings Theres no catalyst in this storybr br One only has to look at the cut scenes to clearly see that Edwards and the writer just came up with ideas inspired by Andrews (and Edwards) previous successes The best (or worst) example is the scene when Andrews and Hudson follows a group of children who sing in the middle of a forest Edwards channeling SOUND OF MUSIC Its no wonder he removed it from the DVD Back in 1970 that scene might have worked on a certain level but today that moment reeks of desperation There are other plot elements directly inspired by AndrewsEdwards other films The endless scenes of dogfights is inspired by the much better MODERN MILLIE The musical moment Ill give you three guesses was created just to make fun of Julies MARY POPPINS persona which is turned raunchy with Julie doing a striptease in the act The ending birds eye view of Julie running towards Hudsons plane is another wink at SOUND OF MUSICbr br The whole thing is confusing Julie plays a singer born from a German father and British mother who lives in England but sings her (English) songs in Paris You never know exactly where the story takes place Some moments are just badly edited Like when Julie and her uncle are on horseback They talk and talk and then Julie suddenly sprints off in mid-sentence Im like what happened here?br br The comedy bits are unfunny and cringe-worthy Every scene with the French police are pathetic Wheres Peter Sellers when you really need him The action is stupid beyond belief When Julie and her uncle are on their way to Germany on that train Hudsons squadron shoots rounds of bullets at the train almost killing Lili in the process Brilliant Whats also funny about that scene is the two leave on the train in the middle of the night but Hudson and his squadron reach the train even though they fly off the next morning Thats one slow moving train there br br The musical moments The beginning is the best part of the entire film (and the reason I gave this film 3 stars) but its effect is diminished considerably because its repeated at the end Speaking of redundant did we really need to see a can-can dance Crepe Suzette stripping scene and Julie stripping too? The Girl in no mans land is OK even if its bleeding obvious but that moment just doesnt make any sense whatsoever because Lili sings it to a group of injured soldiers at a French hospital making me wonder: how many soldiers there were injured indirectly by the result of her spying?br br The whole project is listless and without energy The romance is 100% unbelievable Rock Hudson is way too old and tired looking (check out the museum scene) Julie looks dazed like shes on Valium But what really kills this ill-conceived project is Julie playing a German spy Edwards desperately wanted to dispel the Mary Poppins syndrome afflicting his wife and believed that playing a traitor was a good career decision As much as I like Julie shes no Greta Garbo who pulled it off so beautifully in MATA HARI Funny enough even if Julie plays a German spy she still comes across as cloying and cutebr br How bad is DARLING LILI? Even after 37 years since its release Blake Edwards felt he still needed to work on it for its DVD release
Julie Andrews satirically prods her own goody-two-shoes image in this overproduced musical comedy-drama but if she approaches her role with aplomb shes alone in doing so Blake Edwards film about a woman who is both music-hall entertainer and German spy during WWI doesnt know what tone to aim for and Rock Hudson has the thankless task of playing romantic second-fiddle Musicals had grown out of favor by 1970 and elephantine productions like Star! and this film really tarnished Andrews reputation leaving a lot of dead space in her catalogue until The Tamarind Seed came along Ive always thought Julie Andrews wouldve made a great villain or shady lady; her strong voice could really command attention and she hits some low notes that can either be imposing or seductive Husbanddirector Edwards seems to realize this but neither he nor Julie can work up much energy within this scenario Screenwriter William Peter Blatty isnt a good partner for Edwards and neither man has his heart in this material Beattys script offers Andrews just one fabulous sequence--a striptease 12 from 
Blake Edwards tried very hard to change Julie Andrews image in this film He tried to make her sexy not realizing she already was I think they were both still a bit irked that Julie had not been chosen to film her Broadway success of Camelot and was passed over as not being sexy enough Unfortunately they chose this vehicle to try and assuage this belief It gets to the point where it is almost funny seeing Rock Hudson who we all know now was gay kissing Julie every 2 minutes throughout this movie It seems now that they were not only trying to make you believe that Julie was a femme fatale but that Rock was straight Sadly they have absolutely no chemistry together and the unending kissing scenes start grossing one out The other error they made with this picture was not knowing what kind of movie they were making It is almost three separate movies There is the drama of Julie as the German spy trying to get military secrets from Rock There is an air war movie with lots of footage of WWI vintage planes swooping about and there is the stupid attempts at humor that Blake Edwards seems to think he has to insert in every one of his pictures whether it is appropriate or not In this case it was not The only truly redeeming qualities in this film are looking at the always lovely Dame Julie and hearing her sing in that crystal clear bell-like soprano Of course if you love her you may overlook the weaknesses of this film just because of her You can always tell yourself afterward that it was a hell of a lot better than sitting through STAR!
An obvious vanity press for Julie in her first movie with Blake Lets see Where do we begin She is a traitor during a world war; she redeems that by falling in love; her friends (who are presumably patriots because they are German citizens) are expendable and must die; and she winds up as a heroine OK The scenes with the drunken pilot and the buffoons who work for French intelligence cant even be described and we wont even mention Rocks romantic scenes with a female (By the way when they visit a museum look at his gaze - I reran it on video and its priceless) Is it a farce or is it a romantic classic or is it a war movie? I dont know and you wont either
Some may go for a film like this but I most assuredly did not A college professor David Norwell suddenly gets a yen for adoption He pretty much takes the first child offered a bad choice named Adam As it turns out Adam doesnt have both oars in the water which almost immediately causes untold stress and turmoil for Dr Norwell This sob story drolly played out with one problem after another all centered around Adams inabilities and seizures Why Norwell wanted to complicate his life with an unknown factor like an adoptive child was never explained Along the way the good doctor managed to attract a wifey to share in all the hell the little one was dishing out Personally I think both of them were one beer short of a sixpack Bypass this yawner
Few movies have dashed expectations and upset me as much as Fire has The movie is pretentious garbage It does not achieve anything at an artistic level The only thing it managed to receive is a ban in India If only it was because of the poor quality of film making rather than the topical controversy the ban would have been more justifiablebr br Now that Ive got my distress out of my system I am more able to analyse the movie: br br  From the onset the movie feels unreal especially when the protagonists start conversing in English The director of course did not make the movie for an Indian audience; however it underestimated its international audiences by over simplifying it Watching the character of the domestic help conversing in perfect English is too unreal to be truebr br  Next we get regular glimpses into Radhas dreams These scenes are not very effective They coming up as jarring and obstruct the flow of the movie Im still wondering how that philosophical dialogue connected to the story I felt that the surrealism was lostbr br  The love scenes felt voyeuristic and are probably meant for audience titillation rather than being a powerful statement In any case they do not achieve either of the twobr br  The names chosen for the women Radha and Sita are names of Hindu deities and hence been selected to shock the audiences However since the film wasnt meant for Indian audiences in the first place the shock-through-name-selection is not meant to achieve its goal which is absurdbr br  The quality of direction is very poor and some key and delicate scenes have been poorly handled A better director could have made a powerful emotional drama out of the subjectbr br  The acting felt wooden although Nandita Das brought some life into the role the others were wasted I always thought that Shabana Azmi was a good actress but her talent is not evident in this film The male leads were outright rubbishbr br In case you are a fan of Earth and wish to see more of the director stay away from this one Please
For years Ive been a big fan of Parks work and Old boy is one of my all-times favoritebr br With lots of expectation I rented this movie only to find the worst movie Ive watched in awhile Its not a proper horror movie; theres no suspense in it and even the light part is so lame that I didnt know whether to laugh or crybr br I introduced my younger brother to Chan-Wook Park and what a disappointment he got from this For me an idol has fallenbr br If you loved movies like Old boy the Mr & Lady Vengeance or even his short films on Three extremes dont waste your time the films not worth it
Might end up being the biggest disappointment that I will see in 2009 I seem to be the rare person who disliked Parks Oldboy but I think that his Lady Vengeance and Sympathy for Mr Vengeance are among the best films Ive seen in the 2000s decade Therefore I really was looking forward to see this especially as it got such positive reviews Instead I found the film clichéd and broke little if any new ground to the vampire genre And while I can appreciate a bit of gallows humor in movies like this I felt Park did this at very inopportune timesbr br Others have comparedcontrasted this to Let the Right One In and I have to say that Let the Right One In was far superior to this one and was a fresh take on the vampire genre Sadly Parks take was a tired one
Bloody Birthday opens to a shot of Meadowvale General Hospital There three babies are being born at precisely the same time during a total eclipse A caption informs us that it is now Meadowvale California June 1 1980 Two teenage lovers Duke Benson (Ben Marley) and Annie Smith (Erica Hope) are getting down to business in an open grave They hear noises and Duke investigates Both Duke and Annie are murdered Sheriff Jim Brody (Bert Kramer) is baffled and only has the handle of a childs skipping rope that Annie was holding as a clue Unfortunately before Sheriff Brody can solve the case his youngest daughter Debbie (Elizabeth Hoy) and two of her friends Curtis Taylor (Billy Jayne as Billy Jacoby) and Steven Seton (Andy Freeman) murder him Just as they are finishing Sheriff Brody off another young boy from their class named Timmy Russel (KC Martel) turns up the three killers are unaware of how much he saw Soon after the incident Timmy plays with Steven and Curtis in a junkyard Curtis locks Timmy into an old locker Timmy manages to escape and tell his sister Joyce (Lori Lethin) but she doesnt believe him at first The three children carry on their murder spree Their strict teacher Miss Davis (Susan Strasberg) a lovemaking couple (John Avery and Sylvia Wright) in a van and Debbies older sister Beverly (Julie Brown) are among their victims Joyce begins to have her suspicions about Debbie Curtis and Steven which makes her and Timmy a target for the evil trio Will they be able to convince the authorities that these three innocent looking 10 year olds are really soulless killers?br br Co-written and directed by Ed Hunt I have an intense dislike for this film I think its absolutely awful and doesnt have a single enjoyable aspect to its 83 minute running time The script by Hunt and Barry Pearson gives us no explanation for the child killers motives beyond the solar eclipse that blocks out Saturn and therefore for some bizarre astrological reason these three children dont have any conscience so these are the only children ever born during a total eclipse? If that is true why do they wait until just before their tenth birthdays before starting their killing spree? I guess it just suddenly kicks in right? To its credit it is reasonably well paced but I still found it incredibly boring and tedious to sit through The film as a whole is very unexciting and predictable the children are revealed as the killers within the first 10 minutes and as Ive mentioned next to no motive is given Its very silly at times too Check out the scene where Debbie stops Steven by throwing a bowl of water over him! The Sheriffs death is put down to him falling down some steps yeah right the injuries suffered from that type of accident arent going to be the same as if your beaten to death with a baseball bat like he was in reality any competent Doctor or Pathologist would have spotted that within 5 seconds There isnt a single drop of blood spilt in the entire film and all of the lame killings are dull and unimaginative There is some out-of-place looking nudity as Debbie charges 25c to let boys peek through a hole while her sister Beverly strips There is an early scene just after the 5 minute mark when Joyce walks from the kitchen to the living room and the boom mike is clearly visible at the top of the screen not even a little bit of it the whole damn thing The general incompetence continues throughout the film The whole production is bland and instantly forgettable The acting is poor throughout those three kids are very annoying and got on my nerves right from the start and made sitting through this film even more of a chore especially Curtis in his geeky over-sized glasses I just hate this film really simple as that I cant think of a single good thing to say about it Definitely one to avoid
This movie cannot be serious because it has a nerdy looking kid named Curtis killing people The other two psycho kids are kind of cute but that Curtis kid is just so ugly because he wears these huge brown ugly glasses The actor probably wandered on the wrong set and he was really supposed to go to Revenge of the Nerdsbr br Another thing that I hate so much about this movie is that Curtis takes his sweet time shooting people I kept my finger on the fast forward button because he took too long and what was up with his voice? He sounded like he was fourteen and not ten Another thing I hated was that he kept smiling like an idiot and there was no point to thatbr br Then they put that annoying kid in the freezer and somehow he found a flashlight in there That didnt make any sense and neither did the music The music didnt fit any of the scenesbr br This movie is slow boring and a waste of time Watch a different movie on your birthday
A mean spirited repulsive horror film about 3 murderous children Susan Strasberg is totally wasted in a 5-minute cameo even though she receives star billing If your a Julie Brown fan youll want to check it out since shes naked in a couple of shots All othersavoid
Bloody Birthday is a totally rubbish slasher movie from beginning to end br br I found the acting to be pretty good considering the genre of movie and its obvious low budget I dont know what was going on with the cinematography but it looked ghastly Way too over-saturated Maybe this is a bad transfer to DVD or maybe it always looked like that I dont know br br There really are no redeeming qualities to speak of There are a few deaths but not really gory I wouldnt bother with it if I was you The best thing about the DVD was the 15 minute interview with producer Max Rosenberg who was very amusing and honest He didnt have anything good to say about director Ed Hunt and admits the movie was a failure but he would like to re-make it as he believes it has a decent plot However he died in 2004 so I guess it will be up to someone else to take on that challenge With the way things have been going in the last few years it wouldnt surprise me theres at least one re-make per week at the cinema these day It couldnt be any worse than the original I suppose but I couldnt care less whether it got re-made or not
When you make a film with a killer-kids premise there are two effective ways to approach it; you can either make it as realistic as possible creating believable characters and situations or you can make it as fun as possible by playing it for laughs (something which the makers of Silent Night Deadly Night did for example on an equally controversial subject: a killer Santa) The people who made Bloody Birthday however do neither of those things; they simply rely on the shock value of the image of a kid with a gun (or a knife or a noose or an arrow) in hisher hand The result is both offensive and stupid The whole film looks like a bad idea that was rushed through production (and then kept from release for several years) Its redeemed a tiny bit by good performances from the kids but its VERY sloppily made (12)
When people say children are annoying u think ya my little cousins can be annoying and i said LITTLE These children are turning 10 and they are without a doubt the most annoying bratty children you will ever encounter (in a film) Lets start with the blonde - Debbie - Shes a slut of a girl i mean come on she wears mini skirts she has stupid frizzy blonde hair and a freckley red bunny like face She acts so innocent Next we have the second child - the Geek - who thinks hes so cool with his long range shooting and his use of a silencer (a coat over the gun) and most of all his evil bratty smile The next kid is the quiet one you dont care about so thats all on him This film angered me at the childrens intelligence and the only enjoyment i got was from my cousin who kept bitching about them
Bloody Birthday is an odd and at times humorous low-budget horror flick along the lines of Mikey or a less intelligent version of The Good Sonbr br Set in a small Californian town three babies are born at the height of an eclipse where planetary alignment means they are somehow born without emotions Ten years later our three little psychopaths take themselves on a killing spree doing away with parents siblings teachers and anyone else who irritates them Only one teenage girl knows the truth to be able to stop them There is no explanation for why babies across the world born at the same time arent equally as twisted but there you go!br br For a slasher film its very tame in terms of violence and gore which I suppose highlights the problem of casting child characters as the killers as there is only so much you can expose the young actors to Instead its amusing and a little disturbing seeing three ten-year-olds plotting murders and carrying out their plans using guns knives and crossbows The main reason why it doesnt descend into being totally ridiculous is because the child actors are very convincing in their roles with the way they slyly play the little innocents in front of undiscerning adults while showing their dark side to the girl who knows the truthbr br Bloody Birthday is rather mediocre as a horror flick with few scares and little blood but because it has the shock factor of having kids as the killers it is a bit unique in that way One to watch if theres nothing else on
Is it a poorly acted cliche-ridden pile of trash? Of course Anyone who doesnt realize that when they pick up the box in the video store probably doesnt have any right judging movies in the first place Thus I will now rate the aspects of the film that we actually care about on a scale of 1 to 10:br br Violence and gore: 4 -- For this genre there are very few deaths and the gore is almost non-existent Anyone looking for a little blood should probably look elsewhere The only redeeming quality is the fact that kids are doing these awful things which raises the bar a littlebr br Suspense: 1 -- Okay I feel bad for anyone who gets scared by this trio of dorky looking kidsbr br Nuditysex: 7 -- Lots of boobage from three different women one of whom is the MTV vj Julie Brown There are two sex scenes but little is shown in thembr br Unintentional humor -- 4 -- There are a few good laughs with the kids trying to act scary but all in all its just bad not funny badbr br Overall -- 4 -- Its not unwatchable There are a few fun moments and enough nudity to keep your attention for the entire movie However only watch this movie if youre a big fan of the 80s slasher flicks This definitely falls on the lower end of the scale but its not all the way at the bottom The real downside is the disappointing ending It almost ruined the movie for me
Formulaic slasher film only this one stars three ten year olds (all born during a lunar eclipse) as the killers Nice huh? A little bit of gore and a nice nude scene may make this worthwhile for diehard fans of the genre others bewarebr br 12 out of 
Cover Girl is a lacklustre WWII musical with absolutely nothing memorable about it save for its signature song Long Ago and Far Away This film came out before Gene Kelly really hit his artistic stride and while there are evidences of his burgeoning talent here mostly he plays sidekick to Rita Hayworth And theres the problem Rita Hayworth is gorgeous no doubt about that But shes simply not a compelling screen presence Ive always found myself wanting to like her more than I actually do and this movie is no exception Shes simply not a very good actress and shes not even a very good dancer Good looking as she is theres something vapid about her and this movie suffers because of itbr br Grade: C-
Rita Hayworth plays a Brooklyn nightclub dancer named Rusty who specializes in cheesecake chorus revues; she manages to get herself on the cover of a national fashion magazine but her impending success as a solo (with romantic offers all around) has smitten boss Gene Kelly chomping at the bit Terribly tired piece of Technicolor cotton candy with unmemorable musical sketches (the two worst of which are irrelevant flashbacks to the 1890s with Hayworth portraying her own grandmother) Kelly as always dances well but acts with false sincerity; when hes serious hes insufferable and the rest of the time hes flying on adrenaline The script is a lead weight not even giving supporting players Phil Silvers and Eve Arden any good lines 12 from 
Like Singin in the Rain Cover Girl has a trio of two guys and a girl In Cover Girl Phil Silvers (Genius) is the comic relief He corresponds to Donald OConnors funny man part in Singin in the Rain In Cover Girl Gene Kellys love interest is Rita Hayworth and in Rain its Debbie Reynolds Thats where the comparison endsbr br Whereas Singin in the Rain is a classic American movie musical Cover Girl is mediocrity incarnate The story isnt very complicated Rusty Parker (Rita Hayworth) is a dancer in Danny MacGuires low-rent nightclub in Brooklyn Rusty decides to enter a Cover Girl contest sponsored by a wealthy publisher John Coudair who made an unsuccessful play for Rustys grandmother years ago Coudair introduces Rusty to Broadway producer Noel Wheaton who makes her into a star Danny feels slighted when Rusty starts showing up late for rehearsals at the nightclub and decides to close the club down and go on the road entertaining the troops along with his sidekick Genius At the last minute with Rusty at the altar with Noel she realizes the error of her ways and runs back to Danny They live happily ever afterbr br Gene Kelly has the least developed part in the movie All we find out about him is that he owns a nightclub and is madly in love with Rusty Coudair and Wheaton act like besotted teenagers toward Rusty and Phil Silvers delivers some thoroughly goofy but unfunny shtick The most interesting aspect of Rita Hayworths performance is the scene in which she gets drunk This foreshadows what happened to her in real life Anyone who has read her biography will learn that she disliked Hollywood pined away for a normal home life which she could never attain but eventually began drinking and ended up with full-blown Alzheimers during the last years of her lifebr br Almost all of the songs in Cover Girl are old-fashioned and not very tuneful Gene Kelly has only one really excellent dance number and thats the scene where he dances with his alter ego Earlier the trio has another number which is a pale precursor of Make em Laugh from Singin in the Rainbr br The most annoying thing about Cover Girl is the way in which Rita Hayworth is put up on a pedestal A couple of decades later Raquel Welch had the same problem Both actresses later in their careers would always try and find scripts that showcased their acting abilities They wanted to be known as actresses and not pinup girls Unfortunately Cover Girl is an example of how Hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain
Rita Hayworth is just stunning at times and for me the only reason to watch this silly film Despite the overdone 1940s lipstick Rita was one of the all-time glamor women of Hollywood In fact for a couple of years I cant imagine anyone that looked better except maybe Elizabeth Taylor in her primebr br Anyway the co-star of the show Gene Kelly does not play his normal likable at least the kind of guy we all know him from in Singin In The Rain Here Kellys Danny McGuire pouts much of the time Phil Silvers who I loved on TV at Sgt Bilko is so stupid in here as Genius you will just cringe listening to his dumb jokesand they are stupidbr br The visuals are good with great Technicolor which almost looks terrific You get to see a lot of pretty women in here too not just Hayworth Unfortunately the story isnt all that much It centers around Hayworth deciding about a career choice Along the way we get the normal shabby treatment of marriage and we get an insultingly-dumb ending All in all an unmemorable film except as a showcase for Hayworths beauty
It hurt to watch this movie it really did I wanted to like it even going in Shot obviously for very little cash I looked past and told myself to appreciate the inspiration Unfortunately although I did appreciate the film on that level the acting and editing was terrible and the last 25-30 minutes were severe thumb-twiddling territory A 95 minute film should not drag The ratings for this one are good so far but I fear that the friends and family might have had a say in that one What was with those transitions? Dear Mr Editor did you just purchase your first copy of Adobe Premiere and make it your main goal to use all the goofy transitions that come with that silly program? Anyway some better actors a little more passion and some more appealing editing and this makes a decent movie
This film seems well made and more efforts should be made to promote films by women That aside this film is also profoundly disturbing in that it justifies the manipulative and psychotic machinations of a character that is profoundly disturbed If youve seen any of the promotional material you might think this is a poignant film about a relationship thats reached its end but none of that suggests how really disturbing the central premise is:br br A woman threatens suicide unless her soon to be ex agrees to relive here most treasured memories of their relationship When told how unfair (to say the least) that such a threat is Tessa (the purported protagonist) suggests that lifes not fairbr br Huh??? This character also uses tears to manipulate her former lover into staying and coaxes him into sexually oriented behavior (which she initially denies as a motive) all the while assuring him this isnt sexbr br Reverse the genders have the leads played by Tracey Gold and Brian Austin-Green and this could air in feature length on Lifetime with a title like Hostage to Obsession There is no medically accepted definition of sound mental and emotional stability that would encompass Tessas behavior in this filmbr br Props to Kristen Thomson for playing a border-line psychotic manipulative ex to a T perhaps too well because there is no well-adjusted person male or female who could watch this and not have shivers run up their spine
Sorry but Jacqueline Hyde (get it??? - Jack L and Hyde - Jekyll & Hyde) has some of the worst acting this side of hardcore porn not to mention a script apparently written by a first-grader with undiagnosed learning disabilitiesbr br Jackie Hyde inherits an old mansion by a grandfather she never knew she had Guess who? Yes an inventor of the special formula that slowly takes over ones body and mind - yes that Mr Hyde! br br Despite some nice skin scenes this film fails to register any feeling or emotion other than uncontrollable laughterbr br As much as poor Jackie tries she just cant stay away from granddaddys special formula and the result is an hour and half of wasted time
Jacqueline Hyde starts like any other normal day for telemarketing individual Jackie Hyde (co-producer Gabriella Hall) until her boss (Robert Donovan) fires her for taking personal calls at work however its not all bad news as the call she took was from a lawyer informing her that her Grandfather (Malcolm Bennett) has recently died & that he left her his mansion & fortune (why doesnt stuff like that ever happen to me? Sigh) Very excited Jackie heads on over there & makes herself right at home while looking for the thermostat late one night Jackie stumbles upon a secret room where her Grandfather stashes the bright red formula that he invented that allows whoever drinks it to change their appearance Being a bit on the porky side Jackie finally settles on the glamorous Jacqueline (Blythe Metz) however Jackies better looking alter-ego starts to take controlbr br Written co-produced & directed by Rolfe Kanefsky I thought Jacqueline Hyde was complete total & utter crap from start to finish & its as simple & straight forward as that According to the opening credits Jacqueline Hyde was inspired by the classic Robert Louis Stevenson novel The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde frankly if Mr Stevenson could see what was being done to his story here hed turn in his grave For a start I think Jacqueline Hyde wasis intended to be a horror film the IMDb certainly lists it as such but there isnt any horror in it at all apart from just how bad it is I would say that Jacqueline Hyde is more a soft-core porno than anything else & extremely tame with it why sit down & watch this softer than soft porno crap when you can watch you proper hard-core stuff that actually delivers the goods? Why thats the question I ask here Its not even good porn either besides being far too soft its dull boring & the not-worth-mentioning sex scenes are few & far between The most intelligent aspect of this film is the title which would have been quite clever if not for the fact that another film used the Jacqueline Hyde (1998) title during the last century & judging by the IMDbs plot summary it sounds a hell of a lot better than this piece of rubbish This is one of those films you have to watch yourself to see just how bad it is but just hope that you never get the opportunitybr br Director Kanefsky was obviously working on a low budget but thats not an excuse these days shot on a digital camcorder the film looks cheap & the few instances of CGI look like they came from a Nintendo Gameboy the final shocking twist has probably the worst morph effect Ive ever seen & is pretty good for a laugh as is the scene when Jackies breasts grow via more terrible CGI Thats another thing the film takes itself far too seriously The subject matter sucks is far too predictable & makes for a poor film but maybe if the dialogue had been intentionally funny with some dirty porn talk the film might have been more fun to watch alas it isnt so it isnt Forget about any decent horror violence or gore as there isnt any apart from a surprisingly bloodless decapitation at the endbr br Technically Jacqueline Hyde is home made film type stuff the photography is of the flat hand held point-&-shoot variety the music production design & special effects are of a suitably low standard to match the script The acting was awful seriously this is badbr br Jacqueline Hyde in my opinion a load of crap there is not one positive thing about this turgid film that I can think of Any proper film lover will have an almost impossible time trying to find any redeeming value in this crap definitely one to avoid
Maniratnam who in India is often compared with prominent world film makers and is regarded a genius in film-making has yet again proved that he can only make the frames look visually good without offering much food for thoughtForget about pure cinematic pleasure that can be derived from cinema as a very old form of artbr br While I would not like to claim and portray myself as someone who has seen all the beautiful movies made around the world still any thoughtful and a bit educated film goer can identify that his films do not contain innovative ingenuous plots does not contain lingering effects afterward and MOSTLY contain ridiculous ending and a LOT of melodrama seen profusely in Indian moviesbr br Overall Maniratnam has successfully confirmed my distaste for his films once againbr br Sorry for those who on this board were claiming otherwise My suggestion to you: WATCH SOME BEAUTIFUL CINEMAS MADE AROUND THE GLOBE
This film which I rented under the title Black Voodoo should be avoided I was expecting a blaxploitationhorror flick; but what I got was a very dull standard ghost extracts vegence In this case the ghost was that of a religious cult leader who tried to refuse treatment but whos plea was ignored and he died in an operation The result: his spirit posesses Nurse Sherry and forces her to commit acts of murder The only voodoo connection was to one of the three black characters in this case a blinded ex-football player whos mom practiced voodoo The film is very slow and very dull There is a very standard ending that provides on excitement followed by a horrificly stupid ending (warning: SPOILER)br br In which a woman actually manages to defend herself against murder charges by saying she was possessed This movie is slow and bad in a non-funny just stupefying way Avoid it at all costs
The first 20 minutes were a little fun because I dont think Ive seen a film this bad before {acting script effects (!) etc} The rest of the running time seemed to drag forever with every cliche in dialog used to no effect These people seemed to not really like horror movies or how to make them or any other movie Theres no adult language a bit of brief nudity and no gore except fake blood smeared over no open wounds etc It would have been rated PG in the early eighties and PG-13 nowadays Im not sure how it got an R rating or if it really did I saw the American International release titled Hospital Of Terror Ive seen 100 horror films in the past 12 months and this is probably the worst film Ive ever seen Heres an example of how bad it is: Theres one scene where something green comes through the door Im not sure what its supposed to be but what it is on screen is some kids green crayon scribblings {Im not exaggerating} super-imposed over the film semi-moving inside the door then its supposed to do something to Nurse Sherri to possess her I suppose I could not believe they had the lack of pride to show this embarrassment
I only came here to check Terror Hospital for an alternate title so Id know what not to pick up Not only do I get the original title but I come to find Terror Hospital is one of seven more aliasesThis one is a real clunker Movies like this can usually be forgiven for any number of reasons mostly unintended consequences of the feature on every level of production that result in at least a mild form of entertainment mostly amusement This has none of that Instead the viewer is witness to redundantly unnecessary and way-too-convenient-for-the-situation exposition and drawn out scenes of characters warily moving from room to room and all this is half of the film Forget trying to figure out where anybody is (or who they are) during darkened or nighttime scenes too; you probably wont care anyway There is also a random car chase sequence that seems quite dull when compared to some of the old drivers ed movies I slep er I mean sat through and watched way back in high school Really were talking about mysticism possession and a killer on the loose here - not a bad recipe for trash cinema Unfortunately theres nothing here to make it even good trash; when joined to the aforementioned the bad acting and not-so-special effects are just that - bad acting and not-so-special effects This ones just trash pure and simple Leave it on the rack at the pawn shop or in that box at the yard sale Theres a reason its there
This is a hard film to rate While it truly deserves its 3 (or perhaps even a two) for an Al Adamson film its exceptional--and practically Adamsons very best Thats because unlike many Adamson films there are times when NURSE SHERRI almost looks competent But being an Adamson film you know that sooner or later that crappiness MUST rear its ugly head! br br The film begins with some bizarre cult leader of a huge congregation (six) trying to resurrect a dead guy who looks like hes made of blue cheese However in the process the cult dude has a heart attack and it taken to the hospital He apparently dies but it also seems like many of these hospital scenes are missing and a few of them appear much later in the film In other words when you see the film he appears to have possibly recovered--only to hear later that hed died Because the guy is the bff of Satan however his evil soul cant die and he comes back to both haunt one of his henchmen and to possess Nurse Sherribr br Now Sherri is obviously a very disturbed lady--demonic possession or not At times she acts like a zombie and at others shes violently homicidal So I askwhy didnt her boyfriend (a doctor) think this was perhaps problematic?! In other words after trying to kill a patient he neither gets an exorcist nor commits her to the booby hatch!!! Oh and speaking of boobiesthis movie is NOT the breast-filled sex romp its title and posters would indicate While there are a few bare breasts here and there they are irrelevant to the plot and only seen very briefly (12 second or so) in all but one scene So if you are a perv this movie is not for you--though a few places in the film (such as the nurse undressing for a patient) make it look like the film MIGHT have at one time been designed as a porn flickbr br If you are a bad movie fan however there is enough to whet your appetite Some examples of incompetence are the inability of many of the actors to deliver lines that arent zombie-like--and I am not even talking about Sherri Especially noticeable is one of the very final scenes--I have never seen and heard some stilted acting and dialog in my life--and this includes Ed Woods films! There are also a few more cheap touches such as the bad animation of the green stuff the doctor finding a murdered nurse yet continuing to investigate in a house where walls are covered in blood (Id get a copbetter yet an army of cops)br br So despite these problems why do I think its good for an Adamson film? Well the story isnt all bad and he was able to build tension very well Many false alarms early on made my heart race a bit Also the car crash while irrelevant came off pretty well and was practically big-budget for Adamsonbr br Overall not a good film and one most people would be bored watching However fans of Adamson or inept films will like it--it does deliver some entertainment in a cheesy manner that will provide a few laughs
I bought this on VHS as Terror Hospital and when I got home I checked IMDb and was like OMG its the legendary Nurse Sherri!!! So heres another one from Al Adamson who had clearly learned some minuscule amount about film-making since the Blood of Draculas Castle days Where that earlier effort is a more or less totally sclerotic lump this one mixes it up a little adding a definite element of variety and surprise amid the incompetence Sure half of the movie is a blind post-op football player shooting the breeze with his stacked nurse but at any moment we might be cutting away to the cackling disembodied head of the satanist mastermind or Nurse Sherri running a farmer through with a pitchfork or a wee bit of abstract student-film quick cutting to go with the pulsing-blob effects in the possession scene or the most gratuitously half-hearted topless bit ever or god knows what else (I forget to be honest) As dumb-ass pieces of sht go this one runs toward the high end Congrats Al
The film opens with a cult leader attempting to resurrect a dead member with his followers chanting for his rebirth as the sun strikes upon them in the desert Reanhauer(Bill Roy)believes wholeheartedly in his power and gets so worked up that he collapses with what appeared to be a heart attack Unable to keep him alive all those involved doctors and nurses are sentenced for attack with Reanhauers demonic spirit invading the curvaceous body of nurse Sherri(big-chested Jill Jacobson)targeting each one using her as a tool of vengeance Forced against her will with no memory of inflicting such harm Sherris host body murders selected victims Fortunately Sherris fellow co-worker nurse Tara(Marilyn Joi)begins a rather blossoming romance with a blinded patient Marcus Washington(Prentiss Moulden) once a star football player whose mother was a practitioner of voodoo Through Marcus knowledge passed down from mom Tara finds out about possession and how to possibly save Sherri before she murders everyone unknowingly Meanwhile Sherris lover Dr Peter Desmond(Geoffrey Land)worries about her present condition and welfarebr br Well this was my first Al Adamson film and I must agree with his detractors that just from this film alone it seems he holds them together with paper clips and Elmers glue The animation with which we see the spirit take control of Sherri is beyond awful and rather laughable A little soft-core nonsense as filler some demonic possession thrown in the mix(Sherri actually speaks in another voice when shes possessed) with naughty nurse behavior(the three nurses focused on in the film all are quite sexually active and free-spirited)and a little bit violencegore The film is essentially shot in tiny rooms with dull dialogue from a rather mundane cast The sexual situations arent that hard-core and Al often shoots them without revealing all that much The film looks embarrassingly cheap and theres an absence of thrills although the chilling score(which sounds like something from Dark Shadows)does help a little bit Jacobson and Mary Kay Pass(as nurse Beth who seems to be a nymphomaniac if shell even screw a nutty patient always complaining of illnesses he really doesnt have with enough chest hair to declare him a Neanderthal)arent bad looking and Adamsons story-line although frail is somewhat coherent(it seems he rarely directs films which are) Overall the movie looks like it cost 5 bucks and Adamson just can not overcome the budgetary restrictions(or in my opinion create an unpleasant enough atmosphere due to a sometimes plodding narrative and tedious scenes which do little for the story) John F Goff has the role of the hospitals psychiatrist who wants to commit Sherri not believing the idea that she was possessed;he constantly bickers with Peter over her I watched the unrated lost version which I guess is the real version to watch of Nurse Sherri
Art-house horror tries to use unconventional aesthetics to cover the fact that this is just another serial killer chiller which ultimately relies on pornographic combinations of teen sexuality and violent gore The suburbs come across about as well as they do in every piece of Australian writing (book or film) since 1960 - surprise surprise the suburbs have a dark underbelly - and the plot is as contrived as any youve seen The neighbours would never know about this guy one of the filmmakers says about Joel Edgertons character But he was completely plausible as to what he was Serial killers dont all have patches over their eyes and scars down their cheeks They look like the guy next door Another trader in pornographic violence who sees a serial killer in every street But the real insignificance of this film is in the fact that its a genre film that nobody saw Backed by substantial funds (including some from Film Finance - thats government) this got a run at the Underground Film Festival in Melbourne and had to rely on ACMI kindness for a very short release season Q1: What is the FFC doing funding genre flicks even if they are arty and aesthetically unconventional? Q2: Why are these nasty movies (ACOLYTES; BEAUTIFUL; PUNISHMENT; NO THROUGH ROAD) being made in the first place? Richard Wolstencroft & co encourage their creators to believe theyre giving the masses what they really want as opposed to what the culture elite in government funding think they want The truth is that these brutal and forgettable nasties earn far more critical acclaim - and win far more obscure awards - than theyre due
I was completely bored with this film melodramatic for no apparent reason Every thing just becomes so serious and people are swearing with really dumb expressions Then there is a serial Killer who apparently can Kill one person to get the title of serial Killer Well the serial Killer likes butterflies and is illustrated by sound effects you might hear in the dream sequence of most modern films;br br why oh why? I nave no idea It really really wants to be scary but I think in this universe scary equals talk a whole bunch and add dark ambient noisesJust for the record this is in no way is a horror film its most definitely a thriller (barely) Really movie makers nowadays need to do their homework before making horror films or at least calling a movie a horror film it makes me say (in too may words ironically) acolytes you take forever to say nothing
A rather lame teen slasher from Brisbane While the plot hinges on a fairly decent idea the writing is profoundly lame and two of the three main teens are absurdly wooden The problem is that for the kids to go through with their plan they have to be far more reckless than shown but if they were that devil-may-care it would perhaps be hard for them to be likable so they end up being neither really In fact I only started enjoying the film when I started wishing for their death One of those movies where in about a thousand places the most sensible option would be to call the police I realise we wouldnt have a movie if they did but it would be nice if we could believe that they actually wouldnt Avoid
This was a decent movie for the first half Too many cheap BOO! moments but the tension builds the bad guys are creepy and everything seems to be setting itself up nicely The kids are not particularly deep but hey that works for teens br br Then it just gets ridiculous and tries way too hard- the why in the world would hethey do that? moments overwhelm anyones capacity for suspension of disbelief the twist involves too many ridiculous coincidences and the title comes from a late attempt to philosophize some meaning into the film that goes nowhere and is quickly dropped There was laughter in the theater at moments that were in no way supposed to be funny br br Great premise but just badly written and doesnt hold together Some very nice shots but theyre hard to enjoy while youre rolling your eyes
Acolytes presents an interesting mix of original concepts in screaming teen cliché horror with a more thriller-like pacing In some ways Acolytes is very successful but in many other ways the film fails miserablybr br Overall Acolytes avoided the typical archetypes of the naivety and innocence of youth of endless horror films in the like of Cabin Fever Texas Chainsaw Massacre and countless other films where unsuspecting and relatively naive and innocent teenagers have sex run around screaming and one-by-one are plucked off by some sort of monster Instead this innocence is replaced with pride retaliation and arrogance The characters had several opportunities to save themselves from immanent death and despair but failed to do so due to their own personal demons In the end you were left with the feeling that there were no (and perhaps are no) innocent victimsbr br As the name implies the film also touches greatly on following a leader or authority This was used in a direct sense of if the main character would become like the serial killer and was also used less directly throughout the film Following a central figure is a reoccurring theme throughout the filmbr br Through all this the film makers also incorporated a lot of cliché which I suspect was intentional and gave the film a unique mixture of depth as well as shallowness which I found intriguing This perhaps inadvertently plays well with the characters who are at first appearance very shallow but as the story unfolds it becomes obvious that they are at least the two main male characters quite complexbr br Technically the film has a lot of problems however The cinematography which is typically regarded highly I find rather sophomoric and over-stylized utilizing formulaic 23 approaches far too rigidly Many transitions I felt were also over-stylized The use of symbolism was not only vague but also greatly over usedbr br The plot was poorly planned and relied exclusively on misinformation in order to achieve a rather hokey twist ending which was poorly resolved and leaves viewers confused Methods used to resolve the climax are cheap and ill-prepared motivations are routinely unclear and major plot points remain untied in the endbr br Overall the films relative originality themes and thesis are lost in a maze of poor technical execution over-stylized imagery unclear motives obtuse and unnecessary symbolism and cheap twists maintained only by a lack of or entirely incorrect informationbr br If the film were better executed it would have been excellent However Acolytes receives only two stars in my opinion
I caught this on IFC last week and I thought it was typical of the indie short subject film: heavy on style little on substance and originality Does it comes as any surprise that a coming out film stars an unusually attractive (and blond to boot) boy with 70s shag hair and too-cool-for-school clothes? Plus this film wallows in late 1970s chic which works for some (Sofia Coppolas The Virgin Suicides comes to mind) but not for this directorbr br Another reviewer compared this to Harmony Korines work and I agree Yet I dont view this as a positive thing (what has HE done lately anyway?) Bobbycrush is really just a waste of time and energy for all involved If you happen to see it late night on cable turn the channel and watch something else instead
Its Saturday its raining and I think every movie should have at least one comment so I just watched The Crime Doctors Courage all the way through Its a murder mystery with a typical cast of characters and a couple of the usual suspects -- each with their own possible motive for the crime The story starts abruptly and the viewer is thrown into the plot with no character development or storytelling whatsoever I guess thats not too surprising for a B movie of this period There are also some moments which look and feel like this is pre-WWII but perhaps that is due to the writers background in radio showsbr br The Crime Doctor is the sleuth who happens to be visiting California for some R&R from his psychiatry practice on the East coast He hooks up with a mystery novelist friend with whom it is implied has been along for one or more previous mystery solving capers The novelist occasionally fills the role of sidekick to our sleuth (AKA Dr Watson) and also occasionally lightens things up with a bit of comic relief (sort of)br br There is also a somewhat simple but not quite bumbling police captain who at times is annoyed by the meddling sleuth And then there are the mysterious Braggas a brother and sister who are dance artists at a night-club The dance is sort of an interpretive dance that happens to be one of those moments which feels more like the 30s than the 40s Though the story location is California the Braggas appear to live in a castle!br br There was one plot element which managed to keep me somewhat amused but I wont divulge any more than that because I always enjoy movies more when the story is discovered rather than known in advance (even though I can think of many many B films which would rate higher and it is difficult to say that watching this one is time well spent) I have not seen any other movies from the Crime Doctor series so I cant make any comparisons
Frightmare begins with a horror movie icon killing a director and then his servant before he is laid to rest This icon who has some Christopher Lee qualities to him then continues to haunt those around him when a group of horror film society students steal his corpse from the mausoleum he is inbr br The first ten minutes is well-filmed good writing and lots of potential for murderous mayhem But the film drags in the middle (although thankfully not as much as House of Death) and never really gets that initial spurt of energy backbr br Lots of the deaths are confusing as they seem to have people just falling over scared when they see a floating coffin or other odd things Twice we see poisonous gas being used But the box promises that this horror star will be the embodiment of all the monsters he has played Boy is that false advertising unless he spent his career playing boring old men who take naps and watch Matlockbr br The general principle of the film is decent: horror society kids stealing a corpse of a dead icon A modern equivalent (digging up Vincent Price or Peter Cushing) would make a great film Maybe a remake is in order if that wouldnt be too disrespectful Sometimes theory doesnt come across as well in application and this film offers that examplebr br The only redeeming quality of this film (besides the beginning) is the brief appearance of a very young Jeffrey Combs I saw him and thought thats Jeffrey Combs but felt I was mistaken as the box never mentioned him But sure enough Combs was present (A note to this movies film-makers: mention Combs on the cover of the DVD youll sell more copies if if you would be deceiving customers) If youre a Jeffrey Combs die-hard check out this early role Otherwise I cannot offer this as a great selection for a horror movie marathon Let me suggest Intruder or Popcorn as those are both pretty decent and will stand the test of time
My parents used to rent a lot of horror movies when I was a child We loved watching them even when they were bad they made for some enjoyment This was one such movie kind of hard to review as I have only seen it the one time as a child but it is not anything I want to track down again so I can do a more in-depth review The story has some old horror actor legend dying I seem to remember he acted a bit like an over the top Vincent Price without being likable and classy He commits murders and dies but what is this? Is the movie over already? No as some kids for some reason snag the body and are prepared for a fun night of being killed by the ham from beyond the grave I remember the murders were nothing all that special after the first couple and I remember this movie was rather disappointing Seemed to have a good premise but it just failed to deliver the goods as more cool kills were needed and that super horror actor needed to add a bit to his repertoire
One of the last surviving horror screen greats - Conrad Radzoff - dies and has his body placed in a mausoleum with televised-before-death snippets of the great Conrad greeting you as you visit Unfortunately for him and his captors Conrads body is borrowed by a gang of four boys and three girls and taken to a huge manor where they drink with him toast him dance with him laugh with and at him and then put him to bed in a casket which just happens to by lying in a room upstairs News of the missing body reaches Radzoffs widow and her friend(who happens to be proficient in the black arts) and she holds some kind of ceremony that brings Conrad back to life so he can in his own words get an eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth Well Frightmare is an interesting bad film Sure it is cheap The sets look like they were borrowed(which I am sure they were) The special effects and blood and guts are done liberally and with little credibility The acting is average to below average with a few exceptions Jeffrey Combs of Re-Animator fame is in tow but really he does little in this rather thankless role as a horror obsessed teen that needs to steal a dead mans body for kicks None of the kids except the pretty girl playing Meg is any good Nita Talbot plays the friend of the Radzoffs with withering interest Also look for the big - I mean big - guy that plays the policeman That is Porky himself of Porkys fame But thankfully for all of us one performance does rise above the material Ferdy Mayne an oft overlooked actor from Germany who had Christopher Lee features and did star as a vampire in The Fearless Vampire Killers does a more than commendable job as the aging horror icon in public life and a real demon of a man in private life Conrad Radzoff in a bad human being in life living solely for his own pleasures and we see him kill twice before he is even dead(obviously none of the swinging teens at that point) Mayne is able to look very regal speak very elegantly and convey menace with ease If for no other reason one should see Frightmare for his performance I do; however believe that when they showed black and white clips of Radzoff that they used Christopher Lee footage(anyone have any thoughts?) Anyway one can guess what happens and it does indeed: Radzoff goes out and goes after the kids that disturbed his peace Again the formula is trite and overused The acting for the most part is anemic and the direction oh so ridiculous But Mayne gives a good performance in a sea of ineptitude Definitely worth a little peek Watching Mayne keep popping up on screens in his mausoleum brought a wry smile to my lips each time
Conrad Radzoff(Ferdy Mayne) a hammy cult icon dies from a heart ailment(not before disposing of an ungrateful assistant and TV commercial director both of whom disrespected him with showers of insults) His body is removed from his mausoleum by some film students(they wish to invite him to dinnerthey are quite big fans) What these kids(including a young Jeffrey Combs)dont expect is that Radzoff will be resurrected by a medium to wreak havoc on those who removed him from his place of restbr br The list of violent acts include Radzoff pulling one guys tongue out setting a woman on fire elevating a casket which crushes a womans face decapitates one fellow and cremates another guy alive in a coffin A really weird soundtrack and pesky fog wraps around Radzoffs ghoulish activitiesbr br Silly hokum from Troma is limited by a very very low budget and slowwwwww pace The film feels a lot longer than it is The film isnt really that gory and we can hardly see much violence because the film is often too damn dark At times Radzoff is an ominous presence yet at other times he just looks real silly
I dont get it! The teenage leads in Horror Star supposedly all are devoted horror fans yet when their favorite idol (Conrad Radzoff) passes away they dig up his corpse and do all sorts of disrespectful stuff with it like disco-dancing it around the house and throw food leftovers at it That doesnt sound like something real horror fans would do now does it? Im a big horror fan and I immensely idolize departed icons like Vincent Price Peter Cushing and Boris Karloff but it would never come to my mind to ridicule their memory No wonder Conrad comes back from the dead  admittedly after a séance  to wipe them all off the face of the earth! Mr Radzoff already wasnt known for his friendliness in life since he occasionally killed the directors that disagreed with his visions and even after his death he suffers from a tremendous ego Even inside his tomb there are video messages to petrify possible visitors and the group of teenagers will vividly experience that he also enjoys the murdering business outside his film sets Horror Star (aka Frightmare and Body Snatchers) is a pretty lame 80s horror flick but there are a handful of cheesy & gory highlights to enjoy The film mainly suffers from its own stupid plot since no one  not even a film school student  is stupid enough to steal a recently buried corpse and actually think hell get away with it and there are too many tedious moments to struggle through Conrads video-speeches from beyond the grave are overly talkative and definitely undermine the tension but on the other hand his killing methods are pleasingly inventive One teenager enjoys the experience of getting cremated alive and another one (Jeffrey Combs in one of his first roles!) loses his head in a delightful decapitation sequence In the absolute messiest sequence a poor girl head is crushed by a coffin Writerdirector Norman Thaddeus Vane wanted to bring homage to vintage horror cinema and he obviously how to make film look sinister The locations and scenery are great but Vane lacked the necessary funds to provide his film with a proper continuity and editing-job The acting performances are overall decent with Ferdy Mayne (imitating Christopher Lee) and Jeffrey Combs delivering the most memorable roles Horror Star can hardly be called a must-see or even a good film but its worth tracking down in case youre an admirer of enthusiastically made B-horror
1983s Frightmare is an odd little film The director seems to be trying to combine the atmosphere of classic 30s40s style horror movies with the shock factor of the then-exploding 80s slasher genre It isnt totally successful (mostly due to very obvious budgetary restraints and the less-than-professional caliber of its cast of young actors) but it still has its moments mostly due to the classy performance (classier than the movie deserves) by the late German actor Ferdinand Mayne who plays an aging old time horror movie star (ala Vincent Price) named Conrad Ratzoff At the beginning of the movie we meet the has-been horror star as hes shooting a commercial for dentures and we quickly learn that ol Conrad is a bit of a hoity-toity prima donna jerk-off Just when you think he couldnt be any more un-likable the commercial director berates Conrad for blowing a take for the umpteenth time and the old goat pushes him off a balcony to his death Nice huh? Conrad then visits some fans at a college campus horror movie club unfortunately he suffers a heart attack in the middle of his speech to them and eventually ends up back at his mansion waiting to die Still feisty even at Deaths door he manages to do away with a despised business associate by smothering him with a pillow before he finally kicks the bucket himself Conrad is then laid to rest in true Hollywood style in a high tech neon tomb with video screens above the casket which will play personal video messages from Conrad himself for visitors who enter to pay their respectsbr br It is at this point that the kids from the college Horror Movie Society decide to pay Conrads grave an after hours visit breaking into the tomb and taking his body back home with them for an all night party (Not exactly my idea of fun but hey these are characters in an 80s horror film Logic has no place here) The college kids spend the evening having dinner with Conrads body seated in a place of honor posing for photos with it and even dancing around the room with it before parking Conrad and his coffin in the attic planning to return him to his crypt in the morning In the meantime Mrs Ratzoff distraught over the theft of her husbands body has called in a psychic friend to try and reach Conrad through a seance You can pretty much figure out the rest from here Since Conrad wasnt a very nice guy in life its not much of a stretch to assume that he wont be any friendlier in death Psychic Lady makes contact with Conrad and he re-awakens in predictably ticked off fashion then spends the rest of the movie strolling around the corridors of the students ridiculously huge house picking off the young grave robbers one by one This is where the movie falls apart Endless scenes of teens wandering around empty hallways saying Hello? Is anyone there? are intercut with occasional bursts of violence (we do get a pretty gnarly decapitation scene which is the highlight of the movie) before the last two survivors finally figure out (WAY later than any semi-intelligent people would have figured out the same thingbut again were in an 80s horror film!) that the only way to stop the mayhem is to get Conrads body back to its crypt where it belongs The sluggish pacing is padded out with a lot of weird lighting and dry ice fog effects backed by a soundtrack made up almost entirely of sound effects rather than music(thunder moans and groans howls etc) that becomes severely annoying after a whilebr br I cant really recommend Frightmare to anyone who didnt grow up watching cheap movies like this on late night cable back in the 80s Modern Horror fans will doubtlessly find Frightmare incredibly slow moving and goofy If you came of age in that magical decade however you may get a blast of nostalgia from Frightmare Fans of Jeffrey (Re-Animator) Combs may also want to check it out as the future Dr West appears in an early role here as one of the unlucky film studentsbr br I will advise the reader to avoid the version of this film on the EastWestDVD label (paired with Roy Wards Vault of Horror and sold at dollar stores) because the print quality is terrible Im told the film has gotten a deluxe release via the fine folks at Troma which seems appropriate If youre a Troma kind of person then Frightmare will be right up your alley
I thought maybe maybe this could be good An early appearance by the Re-Animator (Jeffery Combs); many homages to old horror movies; the Troma label on the front this movie could be a gem! I thought wrongbr br Frightmare is a boring overplayed half assed homage to the fright films of yore The story is an old one young people breaking into a house getting drunk making love and tampering with things that shouldnt be tampered with The oft  recycled slasher film formula is used here this time with a thought to be dead actor named Conrad Radzoff doing the killing In fact the performance by the Radzoffs actor Ferdy Mayne is the only redeeming quality of this film He does the snooty Dracula style character very well But as for the kids its not so good with Combs only having a minimal partbr br The film lacks entertainment value and only features one cool character and one or two scenes that can hold your attention I do not recommend this film unless you are desperate for something to watch and this is the only movie left at blockbuster
This show should be titled When Bad Writing Happens To Good Actors considering most of the players have demonstrated immense talent in other venues eg Andre Braugher in Homicide: Life on the Street and David Morse in St Elsewhere Im hoping that the frenetic pacing of the show is adjusted as the series develops along with the obvious cliches and dialogue so absurd I wondered just how stupid the writers imagined the core audience to be Were beat over the head with the main points of this show instead of being left to gradually figure it out almost as if the writers feel that they must spell out that the main character is some sort of avenging angel sentenced to redeem himself from sins both venial and mortal via butting into his cab fares many affairs Watching the premiere required much suspension of disbelief that Mike Olshanskeys fares would so rapidly spill their guts and he would feel driven to intervene in the lives of utter strangers That he possesses those Super-Cop abilities to be all things to all people weapons expert martial arts master psychologist father-confessor locksmith and so on ad infinitum Pure drivelesque fantasy What is it about recent televisions shows based in Philidelphia that they all seem to be imbued with a nasty ex-wife and a very disrepectfully bratty child? Overdone I wanted to like this show really I did because it had the virtue of having a premise slightly different than many of the clones appearing in this seasons fare and it stars some of my preferred actors But Im afraid this is just another possibly good idea ruined by careless execution
generally speaking I dont make negative comments on here But since this is a festival piece I dont want you to waste your time when you could see something else that might not be playing againbr br I thought the actors were pretty bad For instance they totally didnt play off each other rather they waited to RECITE their lines which were pretty poor to begin with The dialogue sounded really forced Norman or whatever his name tried or so it would appear to be witty and biting in the lines he chose but just fell really shortbr br After words he asked if anyone saw the ending coming and some people were all yea and he all but called them liars Look there were so many clues the biggest being a briefcase full of cash for a $500 an hour whore I mean the john gave her at least 20gs tell tale sign Now no you couldnt see exactly what was going to happen but by the time the twist actually occurred I for one didnt even care I was just glad to get out of there I asked him which draft he shot and he said 81 maybe next time he will wait to shoot til 153 cause this needed a lot of workbr br But he seemed like a fairly nice guy he is making his own films hell probably get better and I hope he does not in a snotty way either I mean it I wish him luck Just remember this is just my opinion
That snarlbr br That scowlbr br The acts of random violencebr br The gutteral voicebr br The fetish wearbr br That shaven headbr br It can mean only one thingbr br GRACE JONES IS BACK!br br Actually my sources tell me that the title role in Blade wasnt played by the 1980s diva but by Wesley Snipesbr br All in all this is not an improvementbr br Blade is an adaptation of a comic character; somehow in the transfer from the simplistic two-dimensional world of the printed page it has become even more simplistic and lost a couple of dimensionsbr br The plot is hackneyed almost beyond belief and adds nothing to the vampire genre in fact much like Nosferatu it seems to suck the life out of the audience In brief upwardly mobile vampire wants to become more powerful but is opposed by Blade half-human half-vampire all annoying It all climaxes with Blade being put in a vampire juice press some bad martial arts and the most pitiful CGI since 1968br br Blade has to be the least empathic character since Dolph Lundgrens Punisher (also a comic adaptation perhaps there is a trend here?) Surely the audience is meant to be on the same side as the hero? And whilst a vampire can be a tragic character this is not true of Blade he is relentlessly cruel scornful and not a whole lot better than the bad guysbr br I assume that Wesley Snipes has an acting career purely so that everyone else can be compared favourably As he snarls his way through his movie you find yourself looking for a stake - even a ballpoint pen - anything to put Blade in the grave br br As a piece of narcissism Blade is pretty much unbeatable - we are treated to endless lingering shots of a gym-fresh Snipes for no reason whatsoever Likewise no other actor is allowed any chance to give a reasonable performance; the likes of Steven Dorff CAN act but they have to play second fiddle to Snipes tedious performancebr br Kris Kristofferson used to appear in good movies here he is reduced to a sidekick that you just know isnt going to make it through to the final reel And what happens when Blade finds out? Yes you guessed it he rushes to the scene to wreak his revenge in the villains giant underground lairbr br Why cant world-domination take place in a quiet country house? They always go ahead in underground cathedrals that would have had Albert Speer wondering if they were a little grandiose A lot of these plans could be stopped right now if local councils paid more attention to plans for extending sub-basements br br The rest of the movie is just as dull and unimaginative with nothing new to add to the genre Vampires have been done to undeath and perhaps they should be laid to rest for a while - at least until someone can think of some way to make them interesting againbr br To finish there IS a Grace Jones vampire movie its called Vamp and its about ten times better than this
Not like I went in expecting a lot out of it but I was at least hoping for a fun dumb big budget movie This isnt even that This item ranks in the bottom half of all the vampire movies Ive ever seen (and believe me Ive seen a lot of them) Bad acting zero characterization little to no thought almost non-existent plot (and that thats there you can drive semi-trucks through the holes in) Sure it has action and is loud and has more action and more noise and blood and action These things alone do not make a good (or even halfway decent) movie Beats me how some people can say this is the best vampire movie ever made--all I can assume is they havent seen many I suggest seeing Near Dark instead
Im gettin sick of movies that sound entertaining in a one-line synopsis then end up being equal to what youd find in the bottom center of a compost heapbr br Who knows: Witchery may have sounded interesting in a pitch to the studios even with a big name cast (like Blair and Hasselhoff - wink-wink nudge-nudge) and the effervescent likes of Hildegard Knef (I dunno some woman)br br But on film it just falls apart faster than a papier-mache sculpture in a rainstorm Seems these unfortunate folks are trapped in an island mansion off the Eastern seaboard and one of them (a woman Id guess) is being targeted by a satanic cult to bear the child of hell while the others are offed in grotesque tortuous ways br br Okay right there you have a cross-section of plots from The Exorcist The Omen Ten Little Indians and a few other lesser movies in the satanic-worshippers-run-amok line None of it is very entertaining and for the most part youll cringe your way from scene to scene until its overbr br No not even Linda Blair and David Hasselhoff help matters much Theyre just in it to pick up a paycheck and dont seem very intent on giving it their all br br From the looks of it Hasselhoff probably wishes he were back on the beack with Pam Anderson (and who can blame him?) and Linda well who knows; a celebrity PETA benefit or pro-am golf tour or whatever it is shes in to nowadaysbr br And the torture scenes! Ecchhhh Youll see people get their mouths sewn shut dangled up inside roaring fireplaces strung up in trees during a violent storm vessels bursting out of their necks etc etc Sheesh and I thought Mark of the Devil was the most sadistic movie Id seenbr br Dont bother Its not worth your time I cant believe I told you as much as I did If you do watch it just see if you can count the cliches And yes Blair gets possessed as if you didnt see THAT coming down Main Street followed by a marching bandbr br No stars Witchery - these witches will give you itches
I and a friend rented this movie We both found the movie soundtrack and production techniques to be lagging The movies plot appeared to drag on throughout with little surprise in the ending We both agreed that the movie could have been compressed into roughly an hour giving it more suspense and moving plot
Humm an Italian movie starred by David hasselhoff and Linda Blair I wasn´t expecting very much to be honest and in fact I took even less than I was expecting It doesn´t mean this movie is the worst I have seen because I have watched worse things than this but the plot was most of the times confusing and uninteresting and some good gore scenes are the only thing saving this Apart from that you are going to love some special effects they are really cheesy and bad Now I only want to watch Troll 3 by this same director sure it is not going to be worse than that
We brought this film as a joke for a friend and could of been our worst joke to play The film is barely watchable and the acting is dire The worst child actor ever used and Hasslehoff giving a substandard performance The plot is disgraceful and at points we was so bored we was wondering what the hell was going on It tries to be gruesome in places but is just laughablebr br Just terrible
This only gets bashed because it stars David Hasselhoff Well then let me bash it to Compared to the garbage they call horror coming out nowadays this film isnt too bad It has the beautiful Leslie Cumming She is super hot but cant talk very well There is a great scene with her when she is supernaturally raped She shows off her nice body Linda Blair does nothing here as well as Hasselhoff 310
I watched this movie purely for the setting It was filmed in an old hotel that a friend owns shares of The plot was predictable the acting was mediorcre at best the scares were all gross-outs not true scaresbr br I dont remember much of the plot and I think thats because there wasnt much of one to remember They didnt even use the hotel to its fullest potentialThe beaches are fantastic and the hotel is situated on a peninsula At low tide you can walk almost 14 mile into the bay which is actually an eerie sight first thing in the morning or late at night when the wind is howling through the cracksbr br The best way to see this movie is with the remote in your hand so you can fast forward through the action (and Im using that term loosly)scenes and pause at the beauty of the surroundings!
This film features two of my favorite guilty pleasures Sure the effects are laughable the story confused but just watching Hasselhoff in his Knight Rider days is always fun I especially like the old hotel they used to shoot this in it added to what little suspense was mustered Give it a 3
A really very bad movie with a very few good moments or qualitiesbr br It starts off with pregnant Linda Blair who runs down a hallways to flee what might be monsters or people with pitchforks Im not sure She jumps through a window and wakes up and we see she is very pregnant The degree to which she is pregnant varies widely throughout the moviebr br She and an annoying and possibly retarded little boy who I thought was her son travel to an abandoned hotel on an island Italian horror directors find the most irritating little boys to put in their movies! On the island already are David Hasselhoff and his German-speaking virgin girlfriend (you know how Germans are said to love Hasselhoff) Hes taking photographs and shes translating an esoteric German book about witches I thinkbr br Also traveling to the island are an older couple who have purchased it and a real estate agent and a woman I thought was their daughter Evidently she was an architect and Linda Blair and the boy are the older couples children I guess they all traveled to the island together but it really seemed like Linda and the boy were apart from the rest of them (maybe they were filmed separately)br br The hotel seems neat certainly from the exteriors but it isnt used to any great effect An old woman in bad makeup and a black cloak keeps appearing to the boy and chants something in German sometimes which he eventually records on his Sesame Street tape recorderbr br People start getting killed either in their dreams or sucked into hell or something Some of these gore scenes are OK but not enough to recommend the movie Though the copy I watched stated it is uncut on the box cover the death of one character whose veins explode really seems to have been cut Much of the scene is showing another characters reaction shots since were not seeing anything ourselves The creepiest scene is one in which a man or demon with a really messy-looking wound of a mouth rapes someone He looked particularly nasty Theres a laughably and painfully bad scene in which Linda Blair is possessed I wish if a horror movie is going to cast her they would do something original with her role and let her leave Exorcist behind her (except for the yearly horror conventions)br br In the weird largely Italian tradition of claiming to be a sequel to something it is unrelated to this is also AKA La Casa 4 and Ghosthouse 2 That is it is supposedly a sequel to Casa 3 - Ghosthouse La (1988) - its not (thats also a better movie than this one) La Casa 1 and two were The Evil Dead (1981) and Evil Dead II (1987) - again unrelated to Witchery and La Casa 3 (and much better than those) Theres also a Casa 5 La (1990) AKA House 5 which seems to want to be a sequel to the fake La Casa series and the series House: House (1986) House II: The Second Story (1987) The Horror Show (1989) AKA House III and House IV (1992) Hows The Horror Show fit in there? It doesnt really it claimed to be a sequel thus requiring the real series entry to renumber itself to cause less (or more?) confusion Oddly The Horror Show is also AKA Horror House and La Casa 5 is also AKA Horror House 2 Does your head hurt yet?
Witchy Hildegard Knef traps a group of people in an isolated hotel and picks them off one by one in twisted disgusting ways I thought Id seen it all until one unfortunate man here is crucified and then has his head set on fire Hildy is quite the prankster too: she takes a nagging harpy and sews her mouth shutthen hangs her upside down in the chimney just in time for a roaring fire! Witchery made me sick It made my eyes hurt I was ready to write it off as the worst movie ever-ever-ever made by otherwise competent peopleuntil the finale I have to admit I loved the ending It involves a boy and his toy tape-recorder cornered by Linda Blair looking fantastically possessed The scene only lasts for about a minute and the movies over but you know that old saying: If youve got a great ending people will forgive you for just about anything!
Witchery might just be the most incoherent and lamentably scripted horror movie of the 80s but luckily enough it has a few compensating qualities like fantastic gore effects an exhilarating musical score and some terrific casting choices Honestly the screenplay doesnt make one iota of sense but who cares when Linda Blair (with an exploded hairstyle) portrays yet another girl possessed by evil powers and David Hasselhof depicts a hunky photographer (who cant seem to get laid) in a movie that constantly features bloody voodoo sewn-shut lips upside down crucifixions vicious burnings and an overused but genuinely creepy tune Eight random people are gathered together on an abandoned vacation resort island off the coast of Massachusetts The young couple is there to investigate the places dark history; the dysfunctional family (with a pregnant Linda Blair even though nobody seems to bother about who the father is and what his whereabouts are) considers re-opening the hotel and the yummy female architect simply tagged along for casual sex Theyre forced to stay the night in the ramshackle hotel and then suddenly the previous landlady  an aging actress or something who always dresses in black  starts taking them out in various engrossing ways Everything is somehow related to the intro sequence showing a woman accused of witchery jump out of a window Anyway the plot is definitely of minor importance in an Italian horror franchise that started as an unofficial spin-off of The Evil Dead The atmosphere is occasionally unsettling and the make-up effects are undoubtedly the most superior element of the entire film Theres something supremely morbid and unsettling about staring at a defenseless woman hanging upside down a chimney and waiting to get fried
WitchcraftWitcheryLa Casa 4 and whatever else you wish to call it How aboutCrudbr br A gathering of people at a Massachusetts island resort are besieged by the black magic powers of an evil witch killing each individual using cruel torturous methods Photographer Gary(David Hasselhoff)is taking pictures for Linda(Catherine Hickland whose voice and demeanor resemble EE-YOR of the Winnie the Poo cartoon) a virgin studying witchcraft on the island resort without permission Rose Brooks(Annie Ross portraying an incredibly rude bitch)is interested in perhaps purchasing the resort and along with husband Freddie(Robert Champagne who is always ogling other women much younger than him) pregnant daughter Jane(Linda Blair)and grandson Tommy(Michael Manchester who just looks bored throughout probably wanting to watch Sesame Street instead of starring in this rubbish) go by boat to the resort being treated to a look at the property by Realtor Tony Giordanos son Jerry(Rick Farnsworth) obviously a pup in the business getting his feet wet Along with these folks is architect Leslie(Leslie Cumming whose character is a nympho)who might help Rose re-design the resort The boats captain is killed by The Lady in Black(Hildegard Knef wearing her make-up and lip-stick extra thick)and a storm is brewing The boat drives off by itself(guided by the invisible power of The Lady in Black I guess)with everyone stuck in the decrepit resort which is in dire need of repairs Most of the victims before meeting their grisly fates are carried through a type of red wormhole whose vortex leads to another dimension(perhaps a type of hell or something)where they are tortured by these fiends dressed in raggedy clothes with a crummy visage One victim has her mouth sown before being hung upside down in a chimney roasted as the others light the fireplace One poor soul is tortured by harsh twistings of rope wrapped tightly around her flesh before being found hanging from the snout of a swordfish penetrating through her neck One fellow is slowly suffocating as his veins bulge(and bleed) and necks blood vessels burst squirting in Hasselhoffs face! One fellow is crucified with nails hammered into his hands before being hung upside down over an open flame Blairs pregnant victim becomes possessed with her hair standing on end speaking in another womans voice One is raped by this demonic man with a diseased mouth as the hellish hobos stand nearby gleefully cheering The film despite its excesses is mostly dull fodder for those who really wish to see the lowest point in the careers of Hasselhoff and Blair who deserve better than this Almost unbearable at times building little-to-no suspense Clumsy execution of the death sequences which look cheap and laughable Sure some gore is okay but most of the film shows victims after theyve been run through the ringer We do get a chance to see pregnant women(who look exactly like stuntmen in costume with bad wigs) jumping out three story windows Oh and The Lady in Blacks reflected face often pops up on inanimate objects for characters to see Tommy has a little Sesame Street recorder which tapes The Lady in Blacks mumbo jumbo chants obviously used for later For some reason The Lady in Black likes to visit little Tommy Hes not at all scared of her for Tommys just too bored to show any expression on his face much less fear Need I say more? This ones a real stinker Ugh
There are many different versions of this one floating around so make sure you can locate one of the unrated copies otherwise some gore and one scene of nudity might be missing Some versions also omit most of the opening sequence and other bits here and there The cut I saw has the on-screen title WITCHCRAFT: EVIL ENCOUNTERS and was released by Shriek Show who maintain the original US release title WITCHERY for the DVD release Its a nice-looking print and seems to have all of the footage but has some croppingaspect ratio issues In Italy it was released as LA CASA 4 (WITCHCRAFT) The first two LA CASA releases were actually the first two EVIL DEAD films (retitled) and the third LA CASA was another film by the same production company (Filmirage) which is best known here in America as GHOSTHOUSE To make matters even more confusing WITCHERY was also released elsewhere as GHOSTHOUSE 2 Except in Germany where GHOSTHOUSE 2 is actually THE OGRE: DEMONS 3 OK I better just shut up now Im starting to confuse myself!br br Regardless of the title this is a very hit-or-miss horror effort Some of it is good some of it isnt I actually was into this film for the first half or so but toward the end it became a senseless mess A large vacant hotel located on an island about 50 miles from Boston is the setting as various people get picked off one-by-one by a German- speaking witch (Hildegard Knef) Photographer Gary (David Hasselhoff) who wants to capture Witch Light and his virginal writer girlfriend (Leslie Cumming) who is studying witchcraft are shacking up at the hotel without permission Along comes real estate agent Jerry (Rick Farnsworth) whos showing off the property to potential buyers Rose (Annie Ross) and Freddie (Robert Champagne) Brooks Also tagging along are their children; pregnant grown daughter Jane (Linda Blair) and very young son Tommy (Michael Manchester) as well as oversexed architect Linda Sullivan (Catherine Hickland - Hasselhoffs wife at the time) Once everyone is inside their boat driver is killed (hung) and the boat disappears so they find themselves trapped and basically at the mercy of the Lady in Blackbr br So what can you expect to find here? Plenty of unpleasantries! One of the characters has their lips sewn shut and is then hung upside down in the fireplace and accidentally slow-roasted by the rest of the cast Theres also a crucifixion witches eating a dead baby a swordfish through the head someone set on fire a possession a Sesame Street tape recorder the virgin getting raped by some demon a guys veins bulging and exploding thanks to voodoo doll pokes and some other stuff From a technical standpoint its a nice-looking film with pretty good cinematography a decent score and good gore effects The hotelisland setting is also pretty nice Blair (particularly at the end) and Ross both seem like theyre having fun and Knef is great as the evil witch Even though people like to ridicule Hasselhoff these days hes not bad in his role eitherbr br On the down side despite all the gore the film seems somewhat dull and it gets monotonous after about an hour The supernatural themes are muddled and confusing too When characters are being swept into the witches lair to be tortured and killed the filmmakers unwisely decided to superimpose the screaming actors over some silly looking red spiral vortex effect that looks supremely cheesy And the witch lair itself is vacant and cheaply designed with unfinished lumber And while most of the cast is at least decent a few of the performances (particularly the actress who plays Hasselhoffs girlfriend and the kid) are so bad theyre constantly distracting
Oh my bad clothing worse synth music and the worst: David Hasselhoff The 80s are back with vengeance in Witchery an American-Italian co-production helmed by infamous Joe DAmato on the production side and short-careered director (thank heavens for small miracles) Fabrizio Laurenti directing  Marketed as a kind of sequel to Sam Raimis Evil Dead series in Italy (that was dubbed La Casa in there) Witchery delivers some modest gore groceries and bad actingbr br A mix of ghost story possessions and witchcraft the film bounces clueless from scene to another without letting some seriously wooden actors and hilarious day and night mix-ups slow its progress to expectable ending topped with some serious WTF surprise climax (I just love the look on her face) Surprisingly Laurenti manages to gather some suspense and air of malice in few - very few - scenes; unluckily for him these few glimpses of mild movie magic go down quickly and effectivelybr br The plus sides are experienced when the gore hits the fan This department is quite effective and entertaining in that classic latex and red paint style of the 80s Italo-gore when things were made 100% hand-made and as shockingly and vivid as modest budgets could allow I could only watch with sadistic glee and few laughters all the over-the-top ways that obnoxious characters (and actors) got mangled and misused one by one I only felt sorry for Linda Blair who apparently havent been let to try any other than that good old possessed girl  woman role ever in his career or so it looks like when checking out his filmographybr br Well folks - not much more to tell and even less to tell home about Dont expect too much when spending some rainy afternoon with this and probably youll experience at least some mild fun It also helps if your rotten little heart pounds in the beat of 80s euro gore horror And speaking of hearts - every movie that has David Hasselhoff getting skewered by a sizeable metal object and bleeding heavily around the room and corridors MUST have its one on the right placebr br This is my truth - what is yours?
An ItalianAmerican co-production co-starring Linda Blair and David The Hoff Hasselhoff: how could any fan of trashy horror resist such a treat?br br Well based on the uneventful extremely tedious and utterly nonsensical first forty minutes or so I would have said very easily; thankfully however things do eventually get a tad more entertaining with the introduction of several inventive death scenes and for those lucky enough to find an uncut copy a smattering of nudity too (unfortunately my copy was optically edited to remove such offensive material)br br The Hoff stars as Gary a photographer who accompanies his beautiful girlfriend Leslie (Leslie Cumming) to a run-down hotel on a seemingly deserted island in order to take pictures for her latest project a book about witches; whilst there frustrated Gary also hopes to try and cure a bad case of blue balls by relieving Leslie of her virginitybr br His plans for nookie are scuppered however by the unexpected arrival of property developers Freddie and Rose Brooks (Robert Champagne and Annie Ross) their pregnant daughter Jane (Blair) son Tommy (Michael Manchester) pretty nymphomaniac architect Linda Sullivan (Catherine Hickland) and estate agent Jerry (Rick Farnsworth) who have come to inspect the islands hotelbr br After explaining their unexpected presence on the island Gary and Leslie are welcomed by the propertys new owners and when a violent storm suddenly picks up making it perilous to return to the mainland everyone agrees to spend the night in the old building Unfortunately unbeknownst to the hotels new guests the place is also home to the spirit of an evil witch (Hildegard Knef) who requires human sacrifices in order to bring herself back to life One by one victims are pulled into a swirling red vortex (which is guaranteed to provide unintentional laughs) before meeting a terrible fatebr br None of this makes much sense and the acting is atrocious (Manchester as Tommy is particularly bad whilst Hasselhoff proves to be one of the better performers which speaks volumes about the others) but those viewers who make it past the dreary first half are rewarded with some pretty decent moments of gore: Rose has her lips sewn together before being roasted alive in a fireplace; Jerry is crucified and burnt alive; Linda is tortured by hags and impaled on a swordfish(!!); Freddies veins pulsate and erupt in geysers of blood; and Gary gets stabbed in the backbr br Oh and Leslie is raped by a guy with no lips and Blair gets possessed (again)
Talented screenwriter Alvin Sargent sadly cannot get any engaging ideas cooking in this artificial trifle about a wayward mother and her mature teenage daughter trying to make their lives work in Los Angeles despite moms flighty behavior Apart from several good sequences I didnt quite buy Susan Sarandon as a flake (shes too intrinsically smart and focused to be passed off as this devil-may-care lady) and her naturally grounded personality is a bad fit for the role of an irresponsible parent Natalie Portman fares much better as her kid and yet theres a creepy aloofness to her work (and some of her scenes such as the one where she asks a boy to strip are misguided and uncomfortable to watch) Certainly not an incompetent piece Anywhere But Here does have moments that work but it isnt an embraceable film nor has it proved to be an important one  from 
This film is about a couple that decides to take a vacation to The Everglades along with another couple and the family dog When they first get there they are not welcomed by the neighboring gas attendant that warms them to stay away from the cabin in which they are to spend the night at for the week After pestering with the old man three hillbillys also do not take kindly to their arrival as they approach their car and threaten them to leave After asking some of the local dummies that cant speak or just dont want to answer they finaly find the cabin After they settle in strange things happen to the visitors including discovering crap on their car the man thats the head of this trip thats an idiot shoots the family dog thinking it was a killer clawing at the door and a series of deaths later on in the end Adding a church group did not make the story any better Then at the end the idiot that survives the whole ordeal goes around the town carrying a shot gun Lame thats what this movie is
An obscure horror show filmed in the Everglades Two couples stay overnight in a cabin after being made a little uneasy by the unfriendliness of the locals Who or what are the Blood Stalkers? After awhile they find out Watch for the character of the village idiot who clucks like a chicken he certainly is weird
OK so my summary line is a cheap trick But the movie is full of them and it gets absurdly praised sobr br I caught this one on TV (uncut as TV here shows all movies thats for you Americans who might say I didnt like it because I saw a cut TV version - fortunately thats only an US thing) and had no idea about what it was I switched on caught the last minutes of a show and the movie began Within a minute I was begging it was a comedy given the particularly ridiculous clichéd beginning (yes its a bad movie-within-the-movie I know but what a way to try to keep the viewer interested! I dont even know why I didnt switch channels) And yes in fact the movie turned out to be a comedy albeit an unintentional onebr br Marina Zudina is pretty enough but gosh what a dreadful performance! While casting a foreigner in the role is smart enough (she doesnt talk so bye bye language barrier) yet sorry Marina baby playing mute doesnt mean impersonating Harpo Marx Her acting is unintentionally funny in many moments just look at her when she draws an X in the air while stalked by the killer He wants to kill you its no time to play Zorro We get plenty of running upstairs stuff passing for tension as in the worst slashers and things like pulling a carpet and a bad guy shots the other Ugh! Will Hollywood ever learn? Yet the bestworst pearl is having a guy electrocuted in a bathtub and Well I have never seen anyone being electrocuted to death in a bathtub but Im sure you cant see the blue cartoon rays in real life do you? And how about immediately trusting a mean-looking guy because he SAYS hes a cop and not asking him to show you his credentials? OK so he turns out to be a real cop But still not asking for the badge makes no sense (plot-wise we could always think the credentials might be phony or he might be a crooked cop Screen writing 101) And how about the big twist? Dont tell me you didnt see that coming from 200 miles awaybr br I feel sorry for poor old Alec Guinness and his useless stock footage cameo Now I think about this whats the point in giving him a Mystery Guest Star credit in the END titles? The movies over theres no mystery anymore and everybody and their brother have identified Guinness (even non-movie buffs will recognize the old guy from Star Wars) Yet better off this way so we can pretend its not the late great actorbr br People keep comparing this to of all people Hitchcock I suppose it has to be John Hitchcock the milkman as the late Sir Alfred would feel embarrassed out of watching this let alone making it And this gets a 6810???? Its Bottom 100 material! But then were talking a rating system that allows The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King to appear as the third best movie ever made (check Top 100) sobr br 210
I found this movie really hard to sit through my attention kept wandering off the tv As far as romantic movies gothis one is the worst Ive seen Dont bother with it
No no no no no no NO! This is not a film this is an excuse to show people dancing This is just not good Even the dancing is slow and not half as entertaining as the mediocre Dirty Dancing let alone any other good dance moviebr br Is it a love story? Is it a musical? Is it a drama? Is it a comedy? Its not that this movie is a bit of all its that this movie fails at everything it attempts to be The film turns out to be even more meaningless as the film progressesbr br Acting is terrible from all sides the screenplay is definitely trying to tell us something about relationship but fails miserablybr br WATCH FOR THE MOMENT - When Patrick Stewart enters the scene and you think the film might get better as he brightens up the dull atmosphere For a second
A sprawling overambitious plotless comedy that has no dramatic center It was probably intended to have an epic vision and a surrealistic flair (at least in some episodes) but the separate stories are never elevated into a meaningful whole and the laughs are few and far between Amusing ending though (12)
Okay so it was never going to change the world and it bombed at the box office but Honky Tonk Freeway is one of those films I fell in love with as a child (the BBC showed it a few times during the 1980s and I happened to have a high quality VHS tape in the machine - lucky that!) and watched endlessly I watched the DVD last night and sadly time has not been kind to this would-be blockbuster Either that or Ive just grown out of this kind of broad dopey humour Come on when Schlesinger is so desperate for laughs he gives us close-ups of novelty underpants with amusing slogans what can you say about the cast or screenplay?br br Certainly its ambitious interesting unusual and sprawling but its never once laugh-out-loud funny Id describe it as a childrens film with some adult overtones - you can safely let your youngsters watch this despite the 15 certificate They wont get the drug references so dont worry about it I had a pleasant surprise when I realized Id forgotten just how catchy both the title song and the song-writing truck drivers Everybodys Going Faster Faster song were not to mention the town of Ticlaws patriotic anthem The whole cast give commendable performances the photography is crisp and captures the mood of the various locations perfectly and theres a real time capsule feeling about the fashions the cars the gadgets (especially the dashboard-mounted drum machine) the interiors and the pop-culture references - I was more than a little surprised to hear the nutty bum in the bank loudly telling everyone Im OJ Simpson! particularly now Simpsons legal tangles have overshadowed his sporting achievements The snag is theres almost no plot to speak of its way too obvious to be witty and not funny enough to elicit many genuine laughs I wish Id left this one as a pleasant memory
STMD! is not a terrible movie but it IS quite forgettable The lighting is intentionally poor in many scenes and unintentionally poor in all the rest so you are likely to come out of a viewing with a headache or eye-strain Special effects are imaginative but obvious The gratuitous nudity essential for teen slasher flicks is there of course along with the archetypical teenagers but the whole movie just doesnt gel What was needed was some snappier dialogue and more tongue-in-cheek humorbr br I cant really recommend that you use your time watching this movie I often give a nod to a movie based on just a scene or two that demonstrates imagination or humor but these are sadly lacking in this film
Now I understand that this took two months to shoot Really? Im pretty certain my crew could do it in less than a week This movie sucked so bad I couldnt even pay close attention Just more proof that boob bearing women cant always save you from horrible writing acting and direction Now I understand it was a no budget endeavor but there is also no continuity and no real reason to not to turn it off and watch infomercials or foreign news in a language you dont understand Oh there are a few decent looking females showing the goods Still there arent enough sexy women alive to warrant watching this travesty perpetrated on the film industry One of the longest 80 minutes of my life I trooped it out though with the help of my old friend Jim Beam Do yourself a favor and get your gun ready cuz you may want to use it after this hack job Lastly the individual (moron) who left a comment before mine thought this was a great movie and LOVED it Just more proof that siblings shouldnt pro-create Ow BURN!!! - Captain J
Seeing the title of this movie Stupid Teenagers Must Die made me believe this was a spoof of some kind I discovered later on the original title was Blood and Guts Both titles are misleading though This is not a spoof neither a serious splatter movie This is something in between failing in both areas A group of teenagers is attending a séance at a spooky house and then the killing starts Sounds over familiar doesnt it Well this movies adds nothing whatsoever to the endless stream of similar movies And it is badly made Because of the lack of light the entire film is grainy Now this effect can be highly effective but it isnt in this case The young cast isnt acting too badly but the director has no clue as what to do with actors In numerous scenes the actors are clearly waiting for directions but these are given too late It could also be an editors mistake of course The characters are unrealistic and the story line just stinks The sound is terrible at times: conversations are undecipherable but when talking loudly or screaming the actors are very loud indeedbr br This is not the worst horror movie I have ever seen but it still is a bad one For me a 3 out of 10
I have no idea how anyone can give this movie high marks I didnt rent it thinking it was the next great horror flick the next great horror spoof or the next great low-budget horror spoof Obviously this isnt meant to scare but one fatal flaw with the production entirely sapped the joy out of the viewing experience The sound editing was horrible I had to work the volume control the entire movie You can imagine how difficult it is to get into something - even a low-budget spoof - when youre either turning the volume up or down or trying to anticipate the next time you have to do so The regular dialogue is very low and all screams noises etc are VERY loud Were not talking about toggling between 5 and 7 on the volume control finding a happy medium at 6 Were talking toggling between 2 and 9 on the volume where it is virtually impossible to leave the volume alone Again this movie might be a decent example of what it is meant to be but youre going to be spending so much time adjusting your volume control that youll never have the chance to enjoy it
Widow hires a psychopath as a handyman Sloppy film noir thriller which doesnt make much of its tension promising set-up (310)
I cant believe the high marks people have given this film on this site The writing is incredibly bad with people coming in at just the right time and revealing exactly what the heroine is doing to try to escape (Dont you just hate it when that happens?) And the acting is so very very bad that you may get a splinter in your eye from all the scenery being chewedbr br A nut is holding her hostage children are outside the open screen so she whimpers for help instead of screaming when only a moment ago she was brave enough to be smashing windows to yell to these same childrenbr br Shes finally free and alone in the house Her chance to go for help so what does she do? Wanders around the house and lies down Shes in the basement locked away So what does she do? Takes a little nap Come on! Most of the movie is the nut wandering away and finding her sitting there snoozing when he wakes her up Four times! What? If the writer is too bored to actually write a real plot why should we be paying attention? I think the key here is that it was originally a play for the radio so they filled in with the heroine just sitting around rather than pretending to be screen writers and actually writing any actionbr br And the ending is horrendousbr br The whole movie is completely implausible horribly written and almost comically acted Beware this movie at all costs!
Wow what an overrated movie this turned out to be! It was supposed to be an extremely suspenseful tale of a crazed killer holding a woman hostage and in terror in her home Well I doubt it terrorized audiences in the early 50s and I know it would put todays audiences asleepbr br Sends shivers down the spine proclaims the New York Times No the only shivers I get is that anyone is left on the planet who believes anything the NY Times prints about anythingbr br Well it was about a deranged man who held a woman hostage for a short time in her house but the man Howard Wilton (Robert Ryan) was actually harmless and friendly In fact this was one of the nicest roles Ryan ever played! Yes Wilton was nuts but he never harmed the woman and only wanted a friend to trustbr br The film even turned boring after awhile with very little going on except a lot of yakking br br Beware my readerthis sucks
Artificial melodrama with a screenplay adapted by Mel Dinelli from his play The Man concerns a boarding-house proprietress taking in a troubled handyman who may be homicidal Despite solid work from Ida Lupino and Robert Ryan (both trying their best) this tedious yarn isnt very inventive within its one primary set (which quickly becomes visually dull) and underpopulated cast of characters (there is however a smart pooch who senses the worst!) Hokey and humorless with a stilted direction from Harry Horner (perhaps Lupino should have directed?) Wheres all the suspense promised by the ads? Dinelli also served as a co-producer 12 from 
The only reason this movie is not given a 1 (awful) vote is that the acting of both Ida Lupino and Robert Ryan is superb Ida Lupino who is lovely as usual becomes increasingly distraught as she tries various means to rid herself of a madman Robert Ryan is terrifying as the menacing stranger whose character guided only by his disturbed mind changes from one minute to the next Seemingly simple and docile suddenly he becomes clever and threatening Ms Lupinos character was in more danger from that house she lived in and her own stupidity than by anyone who came along She could not manage to get out of her of her own house: windows didnt open both front and back doors locked and unlocked from the inside with a key You could not have designed a worse fire-trap if you tried She did not take the precaution of having even one extra key Nor could she figure out how to summon help from nearby neighbors or get out of her own basement while she was locked in and out of sight of her captor I dont know what war her husband was killed in but if it was World War II the furnishings in her house the styles of the clothes especially the children and the telephone company repairmans car are clearly anachronistic I recommend watching this movie just to see what oddities you can find
Beware My Lovely (1952) Dir: Harry Horner br br Production: The FilmmakersRKO Radio Picturesbr br Credulity-straining thriller from the pioneering producer team of Collier Young and Ida Lupino aka The Filmmakers (with Lupino pitching in with some uncredited direction) br br Robert Ryan is the peril and Ida Lupino is the woman in this entry in the woman in peril style film Ryan plays Howard Wilton a tightly-wound psychotic handyman drifter (noooo Ryan? I know hard to believe) Lupino is the lonely war widow Helen Gordon who hires Howard to do some work around her house Things go downhill from there as Howard makes Helen a prisoner in her own home br br Howard has a nasty secret not that he could reveal it You see consciousness is a real challenge for him Maintaining it that is He has an unfortunate habit of coming to and finding his employers dead This is part of the films problem The nature of Howards psychosis is so extreme that it is nearly impossible to believe that hes been free to roam from town to town unobstructed even in the year 1918 (when the film is set) He cant remember anything that happened ten minutes ago His violent threatening anti-social tendencies are set off by the smallest and most common of things (a young girl flirting inadequacies involving the war due to his being rejected for service) I dont know how he even made it past the interview with Helen There are other implausibilities If you were locked in your house with a madman but nonetheless left on your own for periods of time couldnt you figure out a way to escape? br br Ryan I think is defeated by the material It feels like hes overplaying his hand His series of tics and spasms and the tightly coiled bursts of dementia all have a been-there done-that robotic feel to them At this point in his career hed probably played this character to some degree ten times and it shows We are encouraged to empathize with Howard (I didnt) through shown bits of humanity like him being stopped in his tracks by a music box and his relating to a group of children who wont judge him Lupino just has to act frazzled and in distress which she is more than capable of and does br br The picture had one thing going for it; what would be the eventual resolution of the conflict? So naturally there was a disappointing ending that was abrupt and ineffective br br Of slight interest was a recurring motif where the camera would catch Howards reflection (in mirrors water Christmas tree decorations) This indicated something going on or about to go on in his head Horner (1953s Vicki) who made his reputation in production design does a fine job of making the house feel like a prison Credit too the always reliable RKO art department for the work on the house In the end sub-standard work from the principals who all have much better films to their credit br br ½ out of 4
this film has no plot no good acting to be honest it has nothing the same songs play over and over awful acting and if you can actually sit there and watch the whole thing and enjoy it there is something wrong with you I wish i could give this 0 out of 10 but i cant so it has to be a 1 which is generous! ice-t isnt even a good rapper and even worse at acting every bit of the film is rubbish i got this film on DVD without knowing what it was for the price of £199 and thought that i had picked up a bargain i then looked at the IMDb rating and didnt take it into consideration but after watching it found out that the DVD i had bought was a complete waste of time money and electricity if you have this film there are two things you can do sell it to someone who doesnt know about it or burn it!
I quite enjoyed The Wrecking Crew (1999) which was the last of the three films in this series (the first being Urban Menace (1999) which Ive yet to see) I know it was baaaaad but the three leads did a pretty decent job all things consideredbr br This however was truly atrocious Ice-T was dreadful and hes the producer! Cant say Ive ever heard of Silkk The Shocker (who apparently never learnt how to spell) but his performance was one of the worst Ive ever seen in a moviebr br Miss Jones did pretty well in her small role though she later went on to make some atrocious racist jokes on her radio show after the SE Asian tsunami (plus other occasions sadly) Way to go girlbr br No-one else comes out with any credit Strangely TJ Storm and Ernie Hudson (who are both pretty bad here) are far better in The Wrecking Crew which was made along with Urban Menace at the same time as Corrupt How that works I dont knowbr br Im going to try the Ice-T commentary now to see whether he apologises for the film or tries to make us think its a great piece of film-making
The most positive points in this film were the credits (text style) and some moments in Ice-Ts acting The story-line; two rival gangs having to fight it out with the sub-plots of betrayal power and change are well worn plots but in this case painful(very) to wade through The decrepit scenery which added slight believability in places and questionable lighting constantly distracted from any interestidentification with the characters (the shine off of the actresss foreheadnose was blinding not to mention other scenes with the same problem) Not even half way into the film I wanted to know more about how and why it came about as opposed to what was going on on screen A disappointment if you have seen Ice-T in other roles Kudos to other actorsactresses who seemed to get into their roles despite the weak direction; Corrupts side kick and the other restaurant worker
Im the type of guy who loves hood movies from New Jack City to Baby Boy to Killa Season from the b grade to the Hollywood but this movie was something different i am no hater and this movie was kinda enjoyable but some bits were just weird well the acting wasnt to good compared to Silkk The Shockers performance in Hot Boyz (quite good) and Ice-T in new Jack and SVU (great) the scene where Corrupt (Ice-T) kills the wanna be Jamaican dude he says something and lights himself on fire burning both Ice-T and the other dude this kills the Jamaican however Ice-T is unharmed very similar to Ices other movie Urban Menace (which stars both of these actors) were Snoops character is supernatural however after this there is nothing suggested that Corrupt is like a demon When MJ (Silkk) gets stabbed at first he struggling but after that he fights normally and was stabbed in the thigh-WITH OUT BLOOD and when MJ confesses killing a cop cos the cop was beating up his friend Benny was weird Benny isnt introduced in this movie and the scene isnt in the film it does hold weight to the fact why Corrupt wants to kill MJ but is still makes u scratch your head wen Jody writes a letter to Miss Jones character explaining what happened to them afterwords doesnt mention what happen 2 other main characters MJ and Lisa the film did show the horror and poverty of the ghetto-which plagues the lives of Latinos and Blacks word wide-was a good part of the film even though the clip of the projects was re-used thousands of times and the scene where Miles kills the Latino brother by crashing his bike at full speed (not wearing a helmet) and running into my Latino brothers car would of killed him the movie was similar to the film Urban Menace and half the actors were in both of these movies as well as the production team it was OK tho but me being from poverty i love hood films however if u dont love em like i do Dont WATCH IT only thing saving me from walking out is it reminded me of the first movie i made which was made with 100 dollars and my love of the genrebr br Nathaniel Purez
Seriously I cant imagine how anyone could find a single flattering thing to say about this movie much less find it in themselves to write the glowing compliments contained in this comment section How many methamphetamines was Bogdonovitch on during the filming of this movie? Was he giving a bonus to the actor that spat his lines out with the most speed and least inflection or thought? The dialogue is bad the plot atrocious even for a screwball comedy and claims that the movie is an homage to classic film comedy is about the most inane thing Ive ever heard The cinematography is below the quality and innovation of that exhibited by the worst made-for-TV movies the acting is awful (although I get the feeling that the fault for that lies squarely in the lap of the director) and speaking of which did I mention the direction is so haphazard and inscrutable that it defies the definition of the word? The whole thing is a terribly unfunny (even in the much-beleaguered world of so-bad-its-funny clunkers) soul-sucking waste of two hours of your life that youll never get back Be afraid be very afraid
Lowe returns to the nest after yet another failed relationship to find hes been assigned to jury duty Its in the plans to somehow get out of it when he realizes the defendant is the girl hes had a serious crush on since the first gradebr br Through living in the past by telling other people about his feelings towards this girl (played by Camp) Lowe remembers those feelings and does everything in his power to clear Camp of attempted murder while staying away from the real bad guys at the same time and succeeding in creating a successful film at the same timebr br Ive heard that St Augustine is the oldest city in the US and I also know it has some ties to Ponce de Leon so the backdrop is a good place to start Unfortunately its the only thing good about this movie The local police are inept the judge is an idiot and the defense counsel does everything in her power to make herself look like Joanie Cunningham! I dont know whether to blame the director for poor direction or for just letting the cast put in such a hapless effortbr br In short this movie was so boring I could not even sleep through it! 1 out of 10 stars!
br br Never ever take a film just for its good looking titlebr br Although it all starts well the film suffers the same imperfections you see in B-films Its like at a certain moment the writer does not any more how to end the film so he ends it in a way nobody suspects it thinking this way he is ingeniousbr br A film to be listed on top of the garbage listbr br 
Four things intrigued me as to this film - firstly it stars Carly Pope (of Popular fame) who is always a pleasure to watch Secdonly it features brilliant New Zealand actress Rena Owen Thirdly it is filmed in association with the New Zealand Film Commission Fourthly a friend recommended it to me However I was utterly disappointed The whole storyline is absurd and complicated with very little resolution Popes acting is fine but Owen is unfortunately under-used The other actors and actresses are all okay but I am unfamiliar with them all Aside from the nice riddles which are littered throughout the movie (and Pope and Owen) this film isnt very good So the moral of the story isdont watch it unless you really want to
I was looking forward to this movie Trustworthy actors interesting plot Great atmosphere then ????? IF you are going to attempt something that is meant to encapsulate the meaning of life First Know it OK I did not expect the directors or writers to actually know the meaning but I thought they may have offered crumbs to peck at and treats to add fuel to the fire-Which! they almost did Things I didnt get A woman wandering around in dark places and lonely car parks alone-oblivious to the consequences Great riddles that fell by the wayside The promise of the knowledge therein contained by the original so-called criminal I had no problem with the budget and enjoyed the suspense I understood and can wax lyrical about the fool and found Adrian Pauls role crucial and penetrating and then ????? Basically the story line and the script where good up to a point and that point was the last 10 minutes or so What? Run out of ideas! Such a pity that this movie had to let us down so badly It may not comprehend the meaning and I really did not expect the writers to understand it but I was hoping for an intellectual if not spiritual ride and got a bump in the road
I gave this a 3 out of a possible 10 starsbr br Unless you like wasting your time watching an anorexic actress in this film its Carly Pope behaving like a ditz dont botherbr br Carly Pope plays Sara Novak a young college student who becomes intrigued with a game of riddles that leads her down into subway tunnels underneath the city - a dangerous thing for even a well-armed man to go in alonebr br There are various intrigues in the film -- a weirdo classmate who is apparently stalking Sara a cynical shopkeeper who runs some kind of offbeat hole-in-the-wall establishment that appears to be located in the back alley of a ghetto a nerdish dim-wit that hangs around the cynics shop and a woman named Emily Gray who is back in prisonbr br Saras father is a lawyer who is handling Emily Grays case br br A few years back Emily Gray attempted to drown a 12 year old boy Emily was put in a mental hospital for 5 years and for some cockeyed reason they let her out again even though it is obvious she is still dangerously derangedbr br The only explanation Emily has ever given for her crime is: I never sinnedbr br Its all part of the designbr br Well my friend dont expect to ever get any better explanation than that because you wont
I of course saw the previews for this at the beginning of some other Lions Gate extravaganza so of course it was only the best parts and therefore looked intriguing And it is to a point A young college student (Sarah)is finding riddles all over the place and is becoming obsessed with answering them and in doing so shes unwittingly becoming involved in some game Now thats fairly intriguing right there but unfortunately it all gets rather muddled and becomes so complicated that the viewer (like myself) will most likely become frustrated Characters appear with little introduction and youre not really sure who they are or why Sarah knows them or is hanging out with them All of this has something to do with this woman who tried to drown a young boy years ago and her reason for that was that its all part of the design In reality its all part of the very sketchy script and when the film is over youll find yourself feeling that youve lost about an hour and a half of your life that you want back for more productive uses of your time like cleaning the bathroom for instance 4 out of 10
too bad this movie isnt While Nemesis Game is mildly entertaining I found it hard to suspend my disbelief the whole length of the movie especially the situations that Sara was putting herself into Are we supposed to believe that:br br 1) this hot chick is going to go slumming unarmed around abandoned buildings and dark subway tunnels in the middle of the night just to solve some riddles?br br 2) the protagonists are supposedly such experts that they play riddle games for fun but dont put the whole I Never Sinned riddle together until the very endand thenand thenget thisshe has to do the whole mirror thing to finally put the pieces together?? I know it was the filmmakers device to show the audience what was going on but do they really think were that stupid?br br 3) when Vern and Sara go to the Chez M to question the blonde there is not ONE topless chick in the whole building Nada Cmon I know its Canada but I would expect more from a country that gave us Shannon Tweedbr br And anyone else notice that when Vern was surfing the Web and found that riddlezone site that when he moused over the link the cursor stayed an arrow and didnt turn into a little hand (LIKE ALL CURSORS DO WHEN YOU CLICK ON A HYPERLINK)?!? I mean if youre gonna have the internet play such a prominent role in your movie at least get the little things right Geez
This movie had a very unique effect on me: it stalled my realization that this movie REALLY sucks! It is disguised as a thinkers film in the likes of Memento and other jewels like that but at the end and even after a few minutes you come to realize that this is nothing but utter pretentious cr4p Probably written by some collage student with friends to compassionate to tell him that his writing sucks The whole idea is  I dont even know if it tried to scratch on the supernatural or they want us to believe that because someone fills your mind (a very weak one btw) with stupid riddles the kind you learn on elementary school recess you suddenly come to the one truth about everything then you have to kill someone and confess !!! What? How what why WHY? Is just like saying that to make a cake just throw a bunch of ingredients and add water forgot about cooking it? I guess these guys forgot to not explain but present the mechanism of WHY was this happening? You have to do that when you present a story which normal everyday acts (lie solving riddle rhymes) start to have an abnormal effect on people Acting was horrible with that girl always trying to look cute at the camera and the guy from Highlanders the series acting up like the though heavy metal record store (yeah theyre all real though s-o-bs) The menacing atmosphere with the oh-so-clever riddles (enter the 60s series of Batman and Robin with guest appearance of The Riddle) and the crazies who claim to have the knowledge behind that smirk on their faces just horrible HORRIBLEbr br Im usually very partial about low budget movies and tend to root for the underdog by giving them more praise than they may deserve in lieu of their constrictions you know but this is just an ugly excuse for a movie that will keep you wanting to be good for an hour and a half and at the end you will just lament that you fell for it
The Forgotten (AKA: Dont Look In The Basement) is a very cheaply made and very old looking horror moviebr br The story is very slow and never really reaches anything worth getting excited aboutbr br The patients at the asylum are embarrassingly funny especially Sam and the old woman who always quotes an old saying to everyone (Look out for the bit when she gets close to the camera tell me you can watch without laughing!)br br Now the gore is very poor looking with the blood looking pink in many scenes so it doesnt really deserve its place on the video nasties list!br br Overall if you arent looking for a fantastic horror film and have some time to spare then its worth a watch
Dr Stephens (Micheal Harvey) runs a mental asylum He has a different approach to the insane He conducts unorthodox methods of treatment He treats everyone like family there are no locks on the patients doors and he lets some of the inmates act out their twisted fantasies He lets Sergeant Jaffee (Hugh Feagin) dress and act as a soldier and Harriet (Camilla Carr) be a mother to a doll including letting her put it to bed in a cot Dr Stevens is outside letting Judge Oliver W Cameron (Gene Ross) chop a log up with an axe it turns out to be a bad move as once Dr Stevens back is turned the Judge plants the axe in his shoulder Soon after Nurse Charlotte Beale (Rosie Holotik) arrives at the Sanitarium having arranged an interview with Dr Stevens about a possible job She is met by the head Nurse Geraldine Masters (Annabelle Weenick as Anne McAdams) and is offered a trail position She gets to know and becomes well liked among the patients However things eventually start to turn sour the phone lines are cut an old lady named Mrs Callingham (Rhea MacAdams) has her tongue cut out and she starts to get a strange feeling that things just arent right somehow Then one night all the Sanitariums dark secrets are violently revealed Produced and directed by Sf Brownrigg this film has a great central idea which builds into a cool twist ending but ultimately is a bit of a chore to sit through because of its low budget restrictions and a rather slow script by Tim Pope There are just too many long boring stretches of dialogue by the inmates not a lot really happens until the final twenty odd minutes The film has no real visual quality as its set entirely in the Sanitarium and its grounds which is basically just a big bland house in the middle of nowhere Theres no graphic gore in it a few splashes of blood here and there and thats yer lot Theres a bit of nudity but like the gore not much The acting is pretty strong especially Holotik and Weenick The photography is flat and unexciting and I cant even remember what the music was like The twist ending is great but it just takes far too long to get to it A film that had a lot of potential that was probably held back by its budget OK I guess but I think it would have worked a lot better if the story had been turned into a half an hour Tales form the Crypt episode
Low budget horror movie If you dont raise your expectations too high youll probably enjoy this little flick Beginning and end are pretty good middle drags at times and seems to go nowhere for long periods as we watch the goings on of the insane that add atmosphere but do not advance the plot Quite a bit of gore I enjoyed Bill McGhees performance which he made quite believable for such a low budget picture he managed to carry the movie at times when nothing much seemed to be happening Nurse Charlotte Beale played by Jesse Lee played her character well so be prepared to want to slap her toward the end! She makes some really stupid mistakes but then thats what makes these low budget movies so good! I would have been out of that place and five states away long before she even considered that it might be a good idea to leave! If you enjoy this movie try Committed from 1988 which is basically a rip off of this movie
Every movie I have PPVd because Leonard Maltin praised it to the skies has blown chunks! Every single one!

Ben (Rupert Grint) is a deeply unhappy adolescent the son of his unhappily married parents His father (Nicholas Farrell) is a vicar and his mother (Laura Linney) is  well lets just say shes a somewhat hypocritical soldier in Jesus army Its only when he takes a summer job as an assistant to a foul-mouthed eccentric once-famous and now-forgotten actress Evie Walton (Julie Walters) that he finally finds himself in true Harold and Maude fashion Of course Evie is deeply unhappy herself and its only when these two sad sacks find each other that they can put their mutual misery aside and hit the road to happinessbr br Of course its corny and sentimental and very predictable but it has a hard side to it too and Walters who could sleep-walk her way through this sort of thing if she wanted is excellent Its when she puts the craziness to one side and finds the pathos in the character (like hitting the bottle and throwing up in the sink) that shes at her best The problem is shes the only interesting character in the film (and its not because of the script which doesnt do anybody any favours) Grint on the other hand isnt just unhappy; hes a bit of a bore as well while Linneys starched bitch is completely one-dimensional (Still shes got the English accent off pat) The best that can be said for it is that its mildly enjoyable - with the emphasis on the mildly
I just finished watching this movie and am disappointed to say that I didnt enjoy it a bit It is so slow Slow and uninteresting This kid from Harry Potter plays a shy teenager with an rude mother and then one day the rude mother tells the kid to find a job so that they could accommodate an old guy apparently having no place to live has started to live with his family and therefore the kid goes to work for a old lady And this old lady who is living all alone teaches him about girls driving car and life! I couldnt get how an 18 year old guy enjoy spending time with an awful lady in her 80s Sorry if my comments on this movie has bothered people who might have enjoyed it I could be wrong as I am not British and may not understand the social and their family structure and way of life Mostly the movie is made for the British audience
This cheap grainy-filmed Italian flick is about a couple of inheritors of a manor in the Italian countryside who head up to the house to stay and then find themselves getting killed off by ghosts of people killed in that housebr br I wasnt impressed by this It wasnt really that scary mostly just the way a cheap Italian film should be A girl her two cousins and one cousins girlfriend head to this huge house for some reason (I couldnt figure out why) and are staying there cleaning up and checking out the place Characters come in and out of the film and its quite boring at points and the majority of deaths are quite rushed The girlfriend is hit by a car when fleeing the house after having a dream of her death and the scene is quite good but then things get slow again until a confusing end when the male cousins are killed together in some weird way and this weirdo guy (I couldnt figure out who he was during the movie or maybe I just dont remember) goes after this one girl attacking her until finally this other girl kills him off Hate to give away the ending but oh well The female cousin decides to stay at the house and watch over it and they show scenes of her living there years later The end You really arent missing anything and anyway you probably wont find this anywhere so lucky you
Now I LOVE Italian horror films The cheesier they are the better However this is not cheesy Italian This is week-old spaghetti sauce with rotting meatballs It is amateur hour on every level There is no suspense no horror with just a few drops of blood scattered around to remind you that you are in fact watching a horror film The special effects consist of the lights changing to red whenever the ghost (or whatever it was supposed to be) is around and a string pulling bed sheets up and down Oooh can you feel the chills? The DVD quality is that of a VHS transfer (which actually helps the film more than hurts it) The dubbing is below even the lowest bad Italian movie standards and I gave it one star just because the dialogue is so hilarious! And what do we discover when she finally DOES look in the attic (in a scene that is daytime one minute and night the next)well I wont spoil it for anyone who really wants to see but lets just say that it isnt very novel!
A group of heirs to a mysterious old mansion find out that they have to live in it as part of a clause in the will or be disinherited but they soon find out of its history of everybody whom had lived there before them having either died in weird accidents or having had killed each otherbr br Youve seen it all before and this one is too low-budget and slow paced to be scary and doesnt have any real surprises in the climax No special effects or gore to speak of in fact the only really amusing thing about the whole film is the quality of the English dubbing which at times is as bad as a cheap martial arts moviebr br 3 out of 10 pretty low in the pecking order of 80s haunted house movies
I saw the Mogul Video VHS of this Thats another one of those old 1980s distributors whose catalog I wish I had!br br This movie was pretty poor Though retitled Dont Look in the Attic the main admonition that is repeated in this is Dont go to the villa Just getting on the grounds of the villa is a bad idea A character doesnt go into the attic until an hour into the movie and actually should have done it earlier because of what is learned therebr br The movie starts in Turin Italy in the 1950s Two men are fighting and a woman is telling them the villa is making them do it One man kills the other then regrets it and the woman pulls out the knife and stabs him with it She flees the villa and after shes left a chair moves by itself (whats the point of that?) but when in the garden a hand comes up through the ground and drags he into the earthbr br From there its the present day thirty years later Theres a séance that appears suddenly and doesnt appear to have anything to do with the movie The children of the woman from the prologue are inheriting the house The main daughter is played by the same actress who played her mother At least one of the two men from the prologue seems to reoccur as another character too Shes haunted by some warnings not to go to the villa but they all do since if they do not use it they forfeit it People die A lawyer who has won all his cases tries to investigate a little The ending is pretty poor Why was the family cursed? An unfortunately boring moviebr br Theres an amusing small-print disclaimer on the back of the video box that reads The scenes depicted on this packaging may be an artists impression and may not necessarily represent actual scenes from the film In this case the cover of the box is an illustration that does more or less accurately depict the aforementioned woman dragged underground scene although there are two hands and the woman is different Its true sometimes the cover art has nothing to do with the movie I also recall seeing a reviewer who had a bad movie predictor scale in which movies with illustrations on the cover instead of photos got at least one point for that
I first watched this movie back in the midlate 80s when I was a kid We couldnt even get all the way through it The dialog the acting everything about it was just beyond lamebr br Here are a few examples imagine these spoken real dramatically way over-acted: Oreegon? Youre going to Oreegon? Why would anyone want to go to Oreegon?br br Survivalists? Nobody ever told us about any survivalists!br br This movie was SO bad my sister and I rented it again for her 16th birthday party just so our friends could sit around and laugh at how awful it was I dont think we were able to finish it then either!
Blind Date (Columbia Pictures 1934) was a decent film but I have a few issues with this film First of all I dont fault the actors in this film at all but more or less I have a problem with the script Also I understand that this film was made in the 1930s and people were looking to escape reality but the script made Ann Sotherns character look weak She kept going back and forth between suitors and I felt as though she should have stayed with Paul Kellys character in the end He truly did care about her and her family and would have done anything for her and he did by giving her up in the end to fickle Neil Hamilton who in my opinion was only out for a good time Paul Kellys character although a workaholic was a man of integrity and truly loved Kitty (Ann Sothern) as opposed to Neil Hamilton while he did like her a lot I didnt see the depth of love that he had for her character The production values were great but the script could have used a little work
This flick is a waste of timeI expect from an action movie to have more than 2 explosions and some shootingVan Dammes acting is awful He never was much of an actor but here it is worseHe was definitely better in his earlier movies His screenplay part for the whole movie was probably not more than one page of stupid nonsense one linersThe whole dialog in the film is a disaster same as the plotThe title The Shepherd makes no sense Why didnt they just call it Border patrol? The fighting scenes could have been better but either they werent able to afford it or the fighting choreographer was suffering from lack of ideasThis is a cheap low type of action cinema
Honestly awful film bad editing awful lighting dire dialog and scrappy screenplaybr br The lighting at is so bad theres moments you cant even see whats going on I even tried to playing with the contrast and brightness so I could see something but that didnt helpbr br They must have found the script in a bin the character development is just as awful and while you hardly expect much from a Jean-Claude Van Damme film this one manages to hit an all time low You cant even laugh at the cheesynessbr br The directing and editing are also terrible the whole film follows an extremely tired routine and fails at every turn as it bumbles through the plot that is so weak its just unrealbr br Theres not a lot else to say other than its really bad and nothing like Jean-Claude Van Dammes earlier work which you could enjoybr br Avoid like the plaque frankly words fail me in condemning this film
Technically Iam a Van Damme Fan or I was this movie is so bad that I hated myself for wasting those 90 minutes Do not let the name Isaac Florentine (Undisputed II) fool you I had big hopes for this one depending on what I saw in (Undisputed II) man was I wrong ??! all action fans wanted a big comeback for the classic action hero but i guess we wont be able to see that soon as our hero keep coming with those (going -to-a-border - far-away-town-and -kill -the-bad-guys- than-comeback- home) movies I mean for Gods sake we are in 2008 and they insist on doing those disappointing movies on every level Why ??!!! Do your self a favor skip it seriously
It actually pains me to say it but this movie was horrible on every level The blame does not lie entirely with Van Damme as you can see he tried his best but lets face it hes almost fifty how much more can you ask of him? I find it so hard to believe that the same people who put together Undisputed 2; arguably the best (western) martial arts movie in years created this Everything from the plot to the dialog to the editing to the overall acting was just horribly put together and in many cases outright boring and nonsensical Scott Adkins whos fight scenes seemed more like a demo reel was also terribly underused and not even the main villain which is such a shame because 1) He is more than capable of playing that role and 2) The actual main villain was not only not intimidating at all but also quite annoying Again not blaming Van Damme I will always be a fan but avoid this one
Isaac Florentine has made some of the best western Martial Arts action movies ever produced In particular US Seals 2 Cold Harvest Special Forces and Undisputed 2 are all action classics You can tell Isaac has a real passion for the genre and his films are always eventful creative and sharp affairs with some of the best fight sequences an action fan could hope for In particular he has found a muse with Scott Adkins as talented an actor and action performer as you could hope for This is borne out with Special Forces and Undisputed 2 but unfortunately The Shepherd just doesnt live up to their abilitiesbr br There is no doubt that JCVD looks better here fight-wise than he has done in years especially in the fight he has (for pretty much no reason) in a prison cell and in the final showdown with Scott but look in his eyes JCVD seems to be dead inside Theres nothing in his eyes at all Its like he just doesnt care about anything throughout the whole film And this is the leading manbr br There are other dodgy aspects to the film script-wise and visually but the main problem is that you are utterly unable to empathise with the hero of the film A genuine shame as I know we all wanted this film to be as special as it genuinely could have been There are some good bits mostly the action scenes themselves This film had a terrific director and action choreographer and an awesome opponent for JCVD to face down This could have been the one to bring the veteran action star back up to scratch in the balls-out action movie stakesbr br Sincerely a shame that this didnt happen
I had high hopes for this one until they changed the name to The Shepherd : Border Patrol the lamest movie name ever what was wrong with just The Shepherd This is a by the numbers action flick that tips its hat at many classic Van Damme films There is a nice bit of action in a bar which reminded me of hard target and universal soldier but directed with no intensity or flair which is a shame There is one great line about being pss drunk and carrying a rabbit and some OK action scenes let down by the cheapness of it all A lot of the times the dialogue doesnt match the characters mouth and the stunt men fall down dead a split second before even being shot The end fight is one of the better Van Damme fights except the Director tries to go a bit too John Woo and fails also introducing flashbacks which no one really cares about just gets in the way of the action which is the whole point of a van Damme filmbr br Not good not bad just average generic action
First off let me say If you havent enjoyed a Van Damme movie since bloodsport you probably will not like this movie Most of these movies may not have the best plots or best actors but I enjoy these kinds of movies for what they are This movie is much better than any of the movies the other action guys (Segal and Dolph) have thought about putting out the past few years Van Damme is good in the movie the movie is only worth watching to Van Damme fans It is not as good as Wake of Death (which i highly recommend to anyone of likes Van Damme) or In hell but in my opinion its worth watching It has the same type of feel to it as Nowhere to Run Good fun stuff!
STAR RATING:  Saturday Night  Friday Night  Friday Morning  Sunday Night  Monday Morning br br Former New Orleans homicide cop Jack Robideaux (Jean Claude Van Damme) is re-assigned to Columbus a small but violent town in Mexico to help the police there with their efforts to stop a major heroin smuggling operation into their town The culprits turn out to be ex-military lead by former commander Benjamin Meyers (Stephen Lord otherwise known as Jase from East Enders) who is using a special method he learned in Afghanistan to fight off his opponents But Jack has a more personal reason for taking him down that draws the two men into an explosive final showdown where only one will walk away alivebr br After Until Death Van Damme appeared to be on a high showing he could make the best straight to video films in the action market While that was a far more drama oriented film with The Shepherd he has returned to the high-kicking no brainer action that first made him famous and has sadly produced his worst film since Derailed Its nowhere near as bad as that film but what I said still standsbr br A dull predictable film with very little in the way of any exciting action What little there is mainly consists of some limp fight scenes trying to look cool and trendy with some cheap slo-mosped up effects added to them that sadly instead make them look more desperate Being a Mexican set film director Isaac Florentine has tried to give the film a Robert RodriguezDesperado sort of feel but this only adds to the desperationbr br VD gives a particularly uninspired performance and given hes never been a Robert De Niro sort of actor that cant be good As the villain Lord shouldnt expect to leave the beeb anytime soon He gets little dialogue at the beginning as he struggles to muster an American accent but gets mysteriously better towards the end All the supporting cast are equally bland and do nothing to raise the films spirits at allbr br This is one shepherd thats strayed right from the flock 
its a totally average film with a few semi-alright action sequences that make the plot seem a little better and remind the viewer of the classic van dam films parts of the plot dont make sense and seem to be added in to use up time the end plot is that of a very basic type that doesnt leave the viewer guessing and any twists are obvious from the beginning the end scene with the flask backs dont make sense as they are added in and seem to have little relevance to the history of van dams character not really worth watching again bit disappointed in the end production even though it is apparent it was shot on a low budget certain shots and sections in the film are of poor directed quality
Worth the entertainment value of a rental especially if you like action movies This one features the usual car chases fights with the great Van Damme kick style shooting battles with the 40 shell load shotgun and even terrorist style bombs All of this is entertaining and competently handled but there is nothing that really blows you away if youve seen your share beforebr br The plot is made interesting by the inclusion of a rabbit which is clever but hardly profound Many of the characters are heavily stereotyped -- the angry veterans the terrified illegal aliens the crooked cops the indifferent feds the bitchy tough lady station head the crooked politician the fat federale who looks like he was typecast as the Mexican in a Hollywood movie from the 1940s All passably acted but again nothing specialbr br I thought the main villains were pretty well done and fairly well acted By the end of the movie you certainly knew who the good guys were and werent There was an emotional lift as the really bad ones got their just deserts Very simplistic but then you werent expecting Hamlet right? The only thing I found really annoying was the constant cuts to VDs daughter during the last fight scenebr br Not bad Not good Passable 4
I love sci-fi and am willing to put up with a lot Sci-fi moviesTV are usually underfunded under-appreciated and misunderstood I tried to like this I really did but it is to good TV sci-fi as Babylon 5 is to Star Trek (the original) Silly prosthetics cheap cardboard sets stilted dialogues CG that doesnt match the background and painfully one-dimensional characters cannot be overcome with a sci-fi setting (Im sure there are those of you out there who think Babylon 5 is good sci-fi TV Its not Its clichéd and uninspiring) While US viewers might like emotion and character development sci-fi is a genre that does not take itself seriously (cf Star Trek) It may treat important issues yet not as a serious philosophy Its really difficult to care about the characters here as they are not simply foolish just missing a spark of life Their actions and reactions are wooden and predictable often painful to watch The makers of Earth KNOW its rubbish as they have to always say Gene Roddenberrys Earth otherwise people would not continue watching Roddenberrys ashes must be turning in their orbit as this dull cheap poorly edited (watching it without advert breaks really brings this home) trudging Trabant of a show lumbers into space Spoiler So kill off a main character And then bring him back as another actor Jeeez! Dallas all over again
The opening of The Jungle promises us a safari adventure with a science fiction element but mostly what we get is a travelogue with lots of stock footage and padding (and the odd leopard attack) The movie is leisurely when you want it to be gripping and tries to inject interest into the proceedings with badly staged matches between various wild animals (I had no idea that lions and wild boars were natural enemies in the wild did you? I thought the big cats stuck to hunting herbivores but apparently the producers knew better) br br As for the actors: Cesar does his usual great job of rocking the mustache and Marie Windsor is reasonably believable as the progressively thinking rajahs daughter (nice eyebrows btw!) However Rod Cameron is barely watchable as the hunter returning as the sole survivor of his expedition Im sure he was in demand in his day but here he comes off as a Rent-A-Center Bogart : rough looking but with none of Bogeys range or timing He spends the movie going back and forth from stoic anger to angry stoicism and any time the screenplay attempts to crank up some romantic sparks between himself and Windsor you just have to laugh That crabbed knobby face isnt a good vehicle for tenderness br br The screenplay is not entirely without merit although it does make some odd choices Early in the first act the screenplay makes a point of spending several moments where the heroes decide to bring along the obligatory clever young boy and monkey mascot but then basically ignore them until SPOILER the monkey somehow gets hold of a live hand grenade during the mammoth scene and accidentally tosses near Windsor This is so Cameron can prove his bravery by diving on it and saving her life at the cost of his ownEND SPOILER Its possible that the Indian version of this movie (which I understand ran better than 2 12 hours) might have given the kid and the monkey more to do br br Another thing that makes the film show its age SPOILERis the issue of the woolly mammoths (the plot device that sets the safari into motion in the first place) When they finally appear the way the scene is filmed its obvious that the mammoths (obviously elephants draped in shag carpeting) arent really attacking anyone or even moving all that fast and yet Cameron immediately sets to trying to wipe them out with hand grenades These days the idea of destroying the last known specimens of a species thought to be extinct would be unthinkable especially when all they seem to do is roll through the jungle at a nice walking paceEND OF SPOILERbr br So IMO four stars which is pretty good for a Robert Lippert production (normally Lippert hack jobs rate two or three stars at best) Its not a train wreck of a film or anything; plus it seems to mean wellwith the rajahs daughter arguing for amelioration of the most repressive aspect of the traditional ways and the elements of mixed race romance that was pretty progressive in 1952 And theres some nice scenery and exotic spectacle See it if someone offers to show it to you for free but dont expect much except an interesting historical chapter of early fantasy cinema
I cant explain what a load of rubbish this film is Like really i cant its just that badbr br plot=crap acting=crap budget=so low its laughablebr br Jesus its like the only good thing in this movie is the fact the main character was fairly hotbr br The only people i feel that think this movie is good are the ones who took part in the film Im sure they are not the ones who funded it because there was no money put into this (HAHAhaha to the bit where there heads get shaved)br br This movie has already wasted too much of my life so i am not going to waste anymore time writing my review for it
From watching the trailer the movie looked pretty interesting The production of the movie is also pretty good--it looks like they had a good budget and doesnt look like a cheaply made movie The acting ranges from good (Joe Morton as Professor Simon) to OK (Kelly Overton as Eve) to bad (James Haven as Don)br br The actual content and plot of the movie is weak The movie starts out like it could become interesting and ends with a poorly executed disappointingly boring twist Watching the first 10 minutes and last 5 minutes of the movie would have made this movie OK but everything in between makes this an absolutely boring movie to watch Its as though they made a short movie then tried to force it to be over an hour long by stuffing the middle with an hour of filler materialbr br If you want to waste a good hour and half of your life watch this movie Otherwise stay away from this extremely boring movie
Breaking Dawn starts in a Californian college as Professor Simon (associate producer Joe Morton) tells his students that they have to perform an intensive six week study of a mental patient in Cape State Hospital as a crucial part of their education fail & they will never become qualified Doctors A bright young attractive & intelligent student named Eve (Kelly Overton) is given a particularly difficult patient to study His name is Don Wake (James Haven) & is a convicted killer he was found covered in blood besides the dead body of a woman (Diane Verona) & her young daughter (Jenette McCurdy) At first Don wont even look at Eve much less talk to her but like the trooper she is Eve persists in trying to figure him out Eventually Don begins to talk but what he says frightens Eve he says that someone is watching her & mentions the name Malachay Eve then begins to see a dark shadowy figure at her every turn as Don churns out the conspiracy theories & bizarre statements Eve slowly begins to lose her mind as the line between fantasy & reality becomes more & more blurred Is there something more to the supposed nonsense that Don talks other than being the insane ravings of a psychiatric patient?br br Written & directed by Mark Edwin Robinson I have nothing but negative feelings towards Breaking Dawn Now we all like a good twist ending the sort of ending which catches us unawares surprises us works well with the rest of the film & stays in our memory like the cool twist endings to The Sixth Sense (1999) & Fight Club (1999) to name just two good examples & to a lesser extent the endings to films such as Scream (1996) where the identity of the killer comes a nice surprise & isnt that obvious Then of course there are films whose endings spoil everything that has gone before & as an example lets take oh I dont know lets say Breaking Dawn because I have never seen such an awful ending to a film never Breaking Dawn starts out as a decent psychological horror thriller with spooky things starting to happen to Eve its not the most action packed film ever by any stretch of the imagination but it holds ones interest its not the most absorbing film ever either but it is more than watchable & its not that bad a film until the twist ending I have to keep mentioning it because everything else up to that point (which was OK to be fair to it) suddenly becomes irrelevant I am sure there are people out there who think they have this muddled mess of an ending figured out down to the last detail all I can say is that no one will be able to explain this thing in a satisfactory way to me & as far as Im concerned it doesnt make a bit of sense & never will Breaking Dawn is crap & its a waste of time watching it to be rewarded with the lamest ending in film history its as simple & straight forward as thatbr br Director Robinson doesnt half make a mess of what could have been a decent thriller maybe he thought what he had shot would play out OK or maybe it was ruined in the editing room but Id imagine it was more likely down to a rubbish script as he tries to tie all the absurdities together within the space of a few muddled minutes & give us all a happier than happy final shot He builds the tension quite well during the first 80 odd minutes but its all for nought at the end of the daybr br Technically Breaking Dawn is fine & it is generally well made throughout The acting is pretty good Overton is nice & easy on the eyes & puts in a decent performance Was it just me or did the guy who played Don look like John Morghen star of such Italian sleaze classics as Cannibal Apocalypse (1980) City of the Living Dead (1980) The House on the Edge of the Park (1980) Cannibal Ferox (1981) Stagefright (1987) & The Church (1989)? OK maybe it was just mebr br Breaking Dawn is rubbish I hated it all because of the final few minutes Dont get me wrong it wasnt exactly getting me excited up to that point but it was OK Definitely one to avoid as far as Im concerned although it seems to have its fair share of positive comments on the IMDb
Let me first start out by saying 1 out of 10 is too good for this movie Its unfortunate that IMDb doesnt have tenths of a star I watched this abortion of a movie in the middle of the night due to insomnia and it was absolute garbage The plot was horrible The acting was horrible The movie was utterly boring malachi looked like the Shadow with Alec Baldwin (The Shadow is infinitely better than this as well) The character Eve was so undeveloped and 2 dimensional she didnt even grab my attention I didnt even know her name was Eve Don was interesting when he kept his mouth shut The TWIST (if you can call it that) was laughable and pathetic When it came the movie had done such a horrid job of building suspense or attachment to any character that I simply thought Who gives a S The only thing that made me even lift an eyebrow about this movie was the fact the med teacher was Dyson in Terminator 2 (Also a movie that was light years ahead of this motion picture massacre) Anyone who was involved in this movie should be ashamed of themselves for wasting 90 minutes of countless peoples time Its no wonder no actor from this movie ever had a fruitful career In summary This movie is so bad I feel dirty and need a shower Worst movie in history Gigli was better Prom Night (the remake) was better and dare I say it Saw IV was better
These days writers directors and producers are relying more and more on the surprise ending The old art of bringing a movie to closure taking all of the information we have learned through out the movie and bringing it to a nice complete ending has been lost Now what we have is a movie that no matter how complex detailed or frivolous can be wrapped up in 5 minutes It was all in hisher head That explanation is the directors safety net If all else fails or if the writing wasnt that good or if we ran out of money to complete the movie we can always say it was all in hisher head and end the movie that way The audience will buy it because well none of us are psychologists and none of us are suffering from schizophrenia (not that we know about) so we take the story and believe it After all the mind is a powerful thing Some movies have pulled it off But those movies are the reason why we are getting more and more of these crap endings Every directorwriter now thinks they can pull it off because well Fight Club did it and it made a lot of money So we get movies like The Machinist Secret Window Identity and this movie (just to name a few)
François Traffauts Mississippi Siren had an unconvincing plot The screenplay required too much elasticity in suspension of disbelief The plot went at a glacial pace It started off in an interesting setting but soon drifted onto the shoals of melodrama that lacked logic or intelligence What were the critics thinking? This one is overrated even to be described as a loser Even Catherine Deneuvue who charmed in The Umbrellas of Cherbourg and Belle Doe Jour managed to be simply annoying br br We rented this movie at the same time as we rented another Traffaut film We watched this one first and found it to be so bad that we sent the other one back unseen at the same time
The first 13 of this movie I loved and thought it was going to be one of Truffauts best films I loved the plot where a pen pal marries a man from half way around the world--sight unseen Especially when this woman turns out to be a fraud and was responsible for the death of the REAL pen pal so she could take her place! She then cleaned out the husbands huge bank account and disappeared! I was really hooked and wanted to see morebr br And then the movie fell apart and became just plain dumb! Despite her coming from New Caladonia (an island in the Pacific) and he from Reunion (an island in the Indian Ocean) when he goes on a trip to the South of France he stumbles upon her almost immediately Hmmodds are 187000000 to 1 but he finds her Then instead of either killing her or turning her over to the police he forgives her--even when she acknowledges what she has done Okay--this is tough to believe but okaybut then he helps to hide her from a private detective by murdering him!!!! No one is that stupid! Yes the character Catherine Deneuve plays is quite beautiful but come on folks--this is just silly Plus if he only wanted her as a sex object then why would he do this for a woman who is often frigid and completely selfish and evilbr br This movie due to its very ridiculous plot does not deserve such high ratings! Unless you are a die-hard Truffaut fan try another film--even one of Truffauts--just NOT this one
Im trying to find something of value here The best I can muster is that Truffaut wanted to make a movie as tedious painful puerile annoying illogical and brainless as the experience of being in love If that was his goal then he succeeded but the solution to his exercise is really a drag to watchbr br There is one scene that screams for a spoof: Belmondo compares the features of Deneuves face to the features in a landscape  All I could think the whole time was glacier ice floe two lonely fishermen wearing Army surplus on a frozen lake in Minnesotabr br The only other point of interest was the resurrection of Buffoons theory of climatic determinism The tropics are presented as paradise and things get progressively worse as they get colder hell being Calvinist French Switzerland That was kind of funny
this is one of the more poorly made movies Ive ever seen One has to take anything by Truffaut seriously; its not just some B-movie cranked out by hacksbr br evidently Truffaut couldnt decide whether he was making a noir or a sentimental chick flick and neither could Deneuve whose dozen (?) character flip-flops are simply unbelievable -- not even badly acted; just not acted at all Among other things how a woman as beautiful as Deneuve could be a person such as JulieMarion is simply beyond anyones ability to suspend disbelief; the role absolutely demands someone not so beautiful Belmondos acting also suffers although imho his character is not quite as unbelievable as Deneuves The cliché ending (which I wont describe) is unfortunately all too appropriate for this complete mistake
IM BOUT IT(1997)br br Developed & published by No Limit Filmsbr br Pros: Absolutely nonebr br Cons: I dont even know where to begin!br br Plot summary: Master P plays a drug dealer that looks talks and acts more like a live-action cartoon character Thats all the plot I got out of this moviebr br Review: I remember back when I was in the ninth grade during its release and everyone in my class praised this clown called Master P This movie is so bad its not even funny All the characters in this film are extremely tired stereotypes the audio is only audible when music plays and the movie looks like it was videotaped off a public access channel Luckily I didnt buy this film like all my other inner-city degenerate classmatesbr br My rating:1 out of 10br br My verdict: Avoid this video like its a sexually-transmitted disease
When I was young Id get up early every Saturday morning not to watch cartoons but to turn on the local channel for what was called Kung Fu Theatre It wasnt as if these films were works of art It wasnt as if these films all came from China Japan Korea or any country in particular; if the story had to do with fighting  be it swordplay or fisticuffs  and if the fighting didnt resemble much of anything going on in any American gym class then that was good enough It wasnt as if they were really even very good They were just great action flicks with incredibly over-dramatic music where the hero reaped his vengeance over a whole host of bad guys and then the credits would rollbr br Sword in the Moon is much like these films of my youth arguably a bit of a thematic throwback given a welcome twist by muddying the characters up enough that it becomes increasingly difficult to tell the bad guys from the goodbr br Yun (Cho Jae Hyun) is known throughout the kingdom as the human butcher He kills quickly and mercilessly on behalf of the Chun Dynasty the chief bodyguard of an Emperor who spared his life and the life of his men in exchange for his service However an equally merciless rebel and his lovely sidekick appear in the countryside and start murdering imperial ministers and Yun agrees to find these rebels and kill them His task becomes one of personal discovery when he learns that the two rebels are Choi (a friend from his past) and his former love Shi Yeongbr br Sadly Sword doesnt have much to distinguish itself from other action films Some stunning cinematography is nearly entirely wasted on shoddy editing with portions of the film put together so loosely its hard to believe that what inevitably made it to the film was what anyone intended While the atmosphere and story tend to gravitate toward a dark mood the tone is almost sacrificed to the never-ending parade of flashbacks as each of the main characters is given a healthy story arc What shouldve been a quick and easy action film gets weighed down by far too much personal baggage and the film suffers as a resultbr br Ive read that this film marks Koreas first real foray into the world of art-house action pieces along the likes of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon Next time Id strongly suggest that the producers stick with a little more martial and a little less art
The success of the original French Emmanuelle series (Ive only watched the first which wasnt too bad considering) led to a spate of imitations; the Italian counterpart which even changed the race of its heroine was clearly less polished and more exploitative - descending more and more into vulgarity as the series went along Incredibly there were 16 Black Emanuelle films in total with the heroine even having the spelling of her name changed to avoid copyright issues!! Still Laura Gemser - the titular object of desire - became almost as much of an icon as the original Emmanuelle Sylvia Kristel (although personally shes too skinny for my tastes)! Here shes even billed as Emanuelle rather than with her real name - with the director likewise becoming Albert Thomas! br br In itself the film offers little of interest: as a matter of fact one would do best to approach it as a travelogue with some decent footage of the African wildlife With respect to the sex scenes I dont know how complete the version I watched was but while there was a lot of nudity none of it was very explicit - or even titillating (the scene that came closest perhaps was when Gemser - who works as a photographer - and her companion Karin Schubert turn the camera on each other naturally sans clothes in the middle of the jungle)! The film also features an artist made up to look like Salvador Dali but mercifully perhaps his scenes do not take much of the running time The score by Nico Fidenco is typically bland 70s pop and really nothing to write home about
Her bit-part as a masseuse in the lurid sequel to the original Emmannuelle evidently gave someone the bright idea of putting a spanner in the works of the French soft-core series gambit by inverting the Caucasian carnality and casting Javan stunner Gemser in a leading role in this the rather tame first of a series of sexploiters that became increasingly depraved as sleazier directors took on in-name-only sequelsbr br Someone (and surely not the English-language over-haulers Warner?) was also anticipating an A Star Is Born type meteoric rise out the results judging by the way the actress is credited merely with the eponymous moniker of the on-screen heroine albeit with a couple of consonants sacrificed as insurance against litigationbr br Gemsers tenure in the series saw her as an intrepid photographer allowing of course for all manner of subsequent globe-trotting adventures But whilst she may well have been one the very most beautiful actresses on the screen at that time any thespian talent that may have been there to discern becomes mired in the same sort of unfeasibly facile cogitation (I have to confess that since Ive been in Africa I find white skin less appealing) that was to be found in the French filmsbr br And in this particular entry much to the consternation of the raincoat brigade the essence of on-screen carnality is as much to be found in puerile symbolism (pumping engine pistons!) as it is in prosaic couplings - although naturally these include generous dollops of exploratory lesbianism Connoiseurs of kitsch are however guaranteed a continuous stream of aural delights what with such epithets of ethnographic wisdom as I do nothing to be a perfect black she does everything to be a perfect white
This movie is over hyped!! I am sad to say that I manage to watch the first 15 minutes of this movie and anything beyond that I will have to force myself real hard to sit down and watch the rest of the movie Its totally stupid and very fake The robot in the movie looks like a man wearing those steel suit and the acting is really bad especially the one playing the character AlienHe is totally annoying!! Dont waste your money watching this sequel to the popular Gen-X Cops Id rather sleep or spend my money on some other things rather than watching this movie 1 out of 10 If possibleId give 0
I saw this movie on VHS some time ago (27 Jan 2003) just because of the name of Paul Rudd on the cover I liked his performance in The Object of My Affection very much and I really expected a good work However I found this film a complete mess The story has a very confused screenplay and the characters are not well developed Further the low-budget special effects do not help much I do not know the previous generation of Gen-Y Cops but this next generation is not good I do not recall exactly why I gave this grade (and I do not intent to see this movie again) but my vote is fourbr br Title (Brazil) : Gen-Y Cops A Nova Geração (Gen-Y Cops The Next Generation)
I somehow managed to make it all the way through this movie but was dumbfounded by the complete lack of entertainment delivered My friends and I are fans of HK film but WOW This movie has it all and by all I mean everything a movie shouldnt have Underdeveloped and stereotyped characters way over-the-top overacting cheesy special effects talking robots no less than 20 double-foot jumpkicks impossible situations unfunny gags and jokes elementary school premise mindless killings and too-long running time for the material Throw in the fact that Gen-X Cops was a decent film and this movie becomes even harder to bear Quite simply if youre entertaining the idea of watching this filmdont
This film is really a big piece of trash trying to make itself look like a Hollywood productionPoor story outline(stupid robot story)ultra bad acting by untalented pop idolsand they are trying toFIGHT!!!My goodnessthose miserable actors uses wires to make them look like they are good fighters:(and I hate that arrogant Edison Chenthe worst actor I have ever seen!!!I will never touch his movies againAVOID this movie at all costs!!!I wanted to give it a negative value out of tennot even worth a 010
Exceptionally silly actioner with braindead leads in a story which would have suited a fill-in issue of Spiderman The action sequences never really flow as they should leaving some cool bits orphaned in a sea of sound and fury signifying nothing I really wonder how theyll release this one in the West Sam Lee overacts like crazy newcomer Edison Chan doesnt display any acting talent yet The robot is clunky and not very impressive and the CGI effects (though done by US sfx-people) are ridiculous totally destroying any remaining suspension of disbelief I am NOT looking forward to Gen-Z Cops
I usually enjoy watching Laurel and Hardy but this is obviously one of the films they made while they were on their way to becoming a successful comedy teambr br The plot is all too simple and is mainly based on one joke; how strange kilts and Scotsmen are And thats all Okay there are some other jokes but I didnt find them very funny at all; they are outdated and (I guess) were not very entertaining when the movie was first releasedbr br Still the movie has got two of the most charming faces in history and they make the best out of the awkward story (which I expect was filmed without a proper script) and the scenery is nice to look at br br In my opinion watching this is only worthwhile for Laurel and Hardy fans other people should stay away from it
i came across this film on the net by fluke and i was horrified by its content of vivid abuse violence and torture scenes it was a relief to know it was not real after reading the comments what dangerously sick animals of a person make something like this and for what purpose goes beyond belief i was even more shocked to see people appraising the film in the comments section of this site this is a extremely disturbing film indeed which could change your life forever the people behind this should be bought to justice asap today they shown a girl getting raped and butchered on screen tomorrow it could be a child even its fake or not its very very deathly disturbingnauseating indeed
just watched this film and it actually made me want to write my first comment on IMDbcom even though ive been a user for more than 9 years the reason that i watched this is because i like splatter films and sometimes i like to test my limits and see what actually still shocks me first of all the gore in this film didnt shock me not even the idea that someone came up with this and made it into a film - what really shocked me is that there seems to be a market for this kind of crap dont get me wrong - im all against censorship but this film seems to me like it was made for some kind of fetish crowd that seems to get off on this type of shtit didnt give you that same kind of disgust and guilt that one felt after watching films like august underground that film is terrible to watch but at least you get the feeling that the filmmakers want to show you how disgusting violence is in the case of niku daruma it seems like it was made strictly to arouse people i prefer films that shock because they are well done and thought through like Gaspar Noes films or Takashi Miikes or Funny Games or Man Bites Dog - those films will stick with you for a while this film i will have forgotten by tomorrow and the only thing that will stick with me is the thought that somewhere out there there are people getting aroused by watching this sht if you read this please check yourself into the next hospital or shoot yourself - this of course does not apply to gore hounds who just love splatter youre cool! peace
Not near as well made as the Guinea Pig flicks it was inspired by (Flowers of Flesh and Blood or Devils Experiment) and not conveying any real philosophy this video feature which is barely feature length adds hardcore sex (with mosaic censoring) to its inspiration The special make-up effects which include stomach slitting and disembowelment are pretty good if overlit The amateur feel of the production is a distraction It all looks cheap and lazy The lighting is harsh and the sound and editing are sloppy The simple story involves a porno actress who ends up starring in a real snuff movie Just when she gets tired of being abused the real abuse begins In the films hero scene an actor cuts the womans stomach open in graphic close-up stuffs his member inside it and proceeds to do his thing I didnt find Psycho - The Snuff Reels shocking On the contrary I found it to be a desperate attempt by amateurs to one-up Guinea Pig and its bloody ilk Interestingly this was distributed by Aroma a leading fetish producer
This movie just didnt do it for me I like horror and splatter movies but this one has very little to do with horror The effects are cheap and when they chop of one of her feet it looks so fake The same goes for the other effects like the tongue torture and the gut sex They could have spent of few extra bucks on the effectsbr br With lots of sex (with pixelization as in all Japanese movies) this is just a sick fetish porn and there seems to be a market for sick stuff like this While bloodier for me it fits in with titles like Squirmfest  Purge and the Genki series These movies feature girls eating and playing with every fluid that comes out of your body eating bugs and fish in a gross way and having sex with all kinds of weird animals like toads eels and One look at the covers will tell horror fans to look elsewhere No horror herejust sick and degrading sex scenesbr br Horror fans should avoid this one and are better of checking out Guinea Pig2: Flowers of Flesh and Blood or even August Underground Mordum While these are not great they at least offer a horror experience and Niku Daruma absolutely fails in that department
Frankie Muniz plays Jason who is a high school student His biggest problem is his life is built on small or big lies that puts him into trouble most times However he cannot escape from his teacher and he finishes his creative writing homework just before its deadline While he is biking fast to hand his homework to the teacher he crushes into a car As he explains the situation to grumpy man(Giamatti) in the car he gives him a lift to his school But the problem is Jason leaves his homework in the car the other way of saying this is Marty Wolf(Giamatti) steals itbr br After a few months Jason goes to a movie and sees a trailer that takes him aback Because the story of the movie is based on his homework He tells that to his parents but of course they dont believe him Especially his father uses words which insults him Jason decides to go to LA and find Wolf to tell his father that Jason is not a liar When Wolf refuses it Jason takes action and ruins his lifebr br This is the short story of the Big Fat Liar Well as a kids movie it might be a light hearted one but there are some errors that even could would ask if that is possible Such as having such a small amount of money and going to LA with a friend to sort the problem out having access to this cinema producers highly protected house and office setting up a telecommunications system overnightDoes it seem believable? It does not Well this is a kids movie but kids are not that gulliblebr br Big Fat Liar offers some little pleasure to its target audience Unfortunately I am not a big fat liar to say that this is a good movie  out of 
I suppose I can see why critics give this film two out five stars it isnt fantastic but I think it is worth a look from director Shawn Levy (Cheaper by the Dozen Night at the Museum) Basically 14-year-old Jason Shepherd (Malcolm in the Middles Frankie Muniz) is often lying to his parents and teachers and his teacher warns him that if he doesnt do his creative writing he will fail his whole semester and have to repeat the grade during summer So he completes his work but getting a lift from Hollywood producer Marty Wolf (Paul Giamatti) who hit him on the way to school he manages to leave his paper with the story Big Fat Liar in the car He finds out from a movie trailer that Marty stole his paper and is turning it into a major movie so he and his best friend Kaylee (Shes the Mans Amanda Bynes) are on a mission to prove Jason is for once telling the truth Marty of course is too nasty and smug to give Jasons father Harry (Michael Bryan French) a phone call and he evens burns the Big Fat Liar paper So now Jason and Kaylee are determined to make Martys life as hellish as possible until he agrees to call Jasons Dad They put blue dye in his swimming pool and orange hair dye in his shampoo and much more naughty pranks creating chaos for Martys career There is the obvious point when Jason looks like he wants to give up but dont worry all characters that despise Marty help out in the final operation and with Jasons parents coming he wants to finally prove his truthfulness and boy does he deliver big style Also starring Amanda Detmer as Monty Kirkham Lee Majors as Vince Donald Adeosun Faison as Frank Jackson Sandra Oh as Mrs Phyllis Caldwell Russell Hornsby as Marcus Duncan Christine Tucci as Carol Shepherd and American Pies John Cho as Dustin Dusty Wong Muniz is likable Byrnes proves a very surprisingly talented support and even though he is wasting his time and talent a little Giamatti is great at being nasty It is a kids film so if it seems corny cheesy or predictable just keep that in mind and try to enjoy the performances and slapstick Okay!
Shakespeare would have been outraged The writers mutilated Shakespeares amazing work Ariel is the only believable acting performance The African voodoo secluded swamp and Gator Man character make the movie a mockery of Shakespeares true Tempest br br Dont waste your eye-sight on this movie
I keep waiting for Peter Fonda to start acting For someone who comes from such a talented family its a mystery to me why Peter Fonda can only play Peter Fonda trying to play someone else And thats the good news in this disappointing dog of an adaptation of The Tempest A string of loosely connected ideas that only suggest a relationship with the Bards great play is what were served The setting is the Civil War and Prosperos (here Guideons) evil brother looks like an 1890s melodrama villain complete with Snidely Whiplash moustache I kept waiting for him to go Uh ha hah! which would have been a high point in this dreary presentation None of the supporting cast was memoriable and Peter Fondas lack of expression and wooden body movements made the lackadaisical story drag on and on br br The Tempest is the Bards statement about the rage of mans unjust treatment of man The only believable character was the Gator man the Caliban counterpart The transferrence to the swamp had possibilities but the Civil War setting just didnt make it All in all a very disappointing production I saw it on video and would advise if you want a Willy Shakespeare fix save your money on this one Rent something else like Branaghs Much Ado about Nothing or Kevin Kline in Midsummers Night Dream
Jack Benders The Tempest is an adaption of Shakespeares play The Tempest Bender transports the plot from medieval Italy to Mississippi during the time of the American civil war He includes the slavery problem and the role of revenge in wartimesbr br Prospero re-named Gideon Prosper is not the Duke of Milan but a landowner in Mississippi He learns voodoo magic from the female slave Mambo Azaleigh He saves her son Ariel who thus accompanies him into his exile The island is not situated on the sea but in a swamp near the banks of the Mississippi There lives an Alligator hunter a so-called Gator-Man who later tries to rape Prosperos daughter Miranda During the time of the civil war Ariel wants to join the Union troops to help fighting against slavery Prospero does not care about the war He is only interested in his personal revenge on his brother Antony When Antony and his bookkeeper Willi Gonzo (Gonzalo) try to cross the river Prospero raises a storm The Union soldier Frederick gets lost in the swamp and finally comes to the island He and Miranda fall in love with each other but Prospero wont accept that Meanwhile Ariel transformed into a raven by Prospero finds out that Antony has feigned to ally with the Union but plans to betray them Antony and Gonzo meet Gator Man in the swamp and conspire with him against Prospero They kidnap Miranda and Ariel but Prospero freeze them and helps the Union defeat the Southern army In the end Ariel is free Frederick and Miranda are bound to marry Prospero returns to the plantation and Gator Man gets back the islandbr br Peter Fonda represents Gideon Prosper powerfully and convincingly while the character of Antony stays rather flat It was no bad idea to perform the Tempest before the background of the civil war but perhaps the director has risked too much In some parts the story seems constructed or comical Gator Man for example does just appear without any explanation That it needs a kidnapping to bring Prospero to his mind and that he loses confidence in his power shows that Bender tried to make Prospero more human but only made him a weak old man without his magic Prosperos original authority and wisdom is not made clearbr br -------------End of Part 1----------------------------
The (DVD)movie The Tempest directed by Jack Bender was published in 2001 It didnt make its way to German cinemas and neither the director or an actor were able to receive an important award for this movie The movie refers to the Shakespearean play The Tempest which was published at the end of the 16th century The director tried to create an modern version of this play but failed At the beginning of the movie the plantation owner Prosper gets in a conflict with his brother Antonio about the treatment of their slaves Antonio sets his brother a trip and tries to kill him but with the help of a witch Prosper is able to escape and flees with his daughter and a slave called Ariel to a small island nearby the Mississippi river For over twelve years he has lived isolated on this island till a lucky chance enables him to take revenge on his brotherIf Prosper will be lucky you have to find out by yourselfbr br In my opinion this film is really a bad try to create a modern version of the original play by William Shakespeare The story of the movie is confusing as well as the characters Prosper doesnt have the same powers as in the tempest END OF PART I
I tried to watch this adaptation but it was just so awful I couldnt torture myself like that The performances were quite sub-par with the exception of Ariel Fonda was way over the top in a role that should be handled with some subtlety I have studied Shakespeare and seen many adaptations and this is by far the worst one I have ever seen I have to wonder why on Earth someone made this film Shakespeare can and has been beautifully adapted in many cases This is not one of them If you must watch this film may I suggest a drinking game? Take a drink every time they go off book from the original idea and two drinks every time Fonda overacts You should be quite drunk in a very short time
This film fails on every count For a start it is pretentious striving to be significant and failing miserably The script was banal in the extreme nobody at any time said anything remotely interesting It was impossible to care about any of the characters Knightly was a self-regarding waste of time whilst Sienna Miller was just a waste of time The bit about the soldier who went off to war was a cliché even before the film Atonement used it The use of the Second World War as a backdrop was in itself a clichéthe bombs the sheltering in tube stations etcemployed to import a bit of much-needed drama Why anybody thought for a moment that this film was worth making is quite beyond my comprehension It was yet another case of lets get the costumes looking authentic never mind about the story the script or the acting!
My godi have not seen such an awful movie in a longlong timesaw it last night and wanted to leave after 20 minuteskeira knightley tries really really hard in this one but she cant handle itdropped her accent every once in a while and didnt have the charisma to fill the rolesienna millers acting gets you to a point where you start to ask yourself: Has she ever had acting lessons? judging by the edge of love shes never been to acting class but should consider to go in the near futurethey both look really prettymaybe thats what they should focus on in their future careerif they can be actresses everybody can!
This film is about the complicated friendship romance and deceit between two men and two women during the World War IIbr br A lot of effort has been put to make The Edge of Lovelook the right period However I find this effort too excessive particularly in terms of the tone of the colours Most of the first half of the film is processed so much to have a strong bluish tone Its hard to make out whos who in this tonebr br Another detrimental point is the fancy use of image splitting lens There are many scenes that have three or four images of the same thing such as three Keira Knightley smiling face or four pairs of arms in embrace That simply makes the film confusing and hard to follow instead of being artisticbr br As for the plot it is plain boring The way the story unfolds is not engaging at all Sienna Millers unstable character is annoying In fact all the main characters are annoying and unlikeable Keira Knightleys accent is impossible to understand making it a further impediment to understanding the plotbr br I strongly advise avoiding The Edge of Love unless you watch a film only to appreciate great costumes nice sets and lighting
I just got done watching The Edge of Love (by the way this is one of the worst titles so far this year) and it felt like a chore Watching Keira Knightlys unlikable skeleton-looking character made me cringe even more throughout the coarse of the filmbr br It took me four nights to watch this it was so boring The only good thing about it was Cillian Murphy Hes always goodbelievable and is severely under looked in many films This however was just not good enough for himbr br Apart from the unlikable characters boring storyline the plot was also emotionally unsatisfying I felt like I spent my time watching this for nothing (which I did) I should have done the smart thing and turned it off but I kept it on out of respect for Cillian Murphy and the great cinematography
i cant believe how dumb this movie truly is the storyline (written by keira knightleys mother) is what ruins the movie to the extreme it is straight out dull absurd and makes absolutely no sense whatsoeverbr br this movie lagged so bad for most of it especially at the beginning the story just kept going on and on about their everyday flirts with each other often times seeming like a threesome in this movie you have an annoying deadbeat couple (the poet and his wife) who are complete total drunks from the start the wife sleeps around with other men to make ends meet while the poet is a pervert who thrives on cheap boos and women the wife who waaayyyyyy too quickly becomes friends with his former childhood lover (played by keira) suddenly gets jealous knowing full well that the two were lovers since they were kids something doesnt seem right herei mean come on get with the program lady! whatd you expectbr br bottom line is: former lovers meet again with new wife embracing it then gets jealous then former woman lover gets married and her husband gets jealous bombards the crazy drunk couples home crazy husband calls police and they end up going to court for the mans attempted murder charges thats it summed up in a nutshellbr br this movie had its moments such as the quality and good acting by cillian murphy but other than that i cannot believe i watched it i complained about it during the movie and some family members watching it with me fell asleep i decided to give it a chance and i should have stuck to my first instincts
This movie is so dull I spent half of it on IMDb while it was open in another tab on Netflix trying to find out if anyone thought it was one of the more boring ponderous gimmicky films theyve ever seen A warning: I actually could not finish it so these are my impressions up to minute 54br br Keira Knightly gets loads of screen time As others have mentioned her mother penned the script (perhaps during some sort of drug-induced stupor wherein utter inanities and emotionless statements about emotions sounded like interesting dialogue) and it seems that the film is a showcase for Knightly Oops! Although I agree she is lovely (with her teeth unexposedher barred teeth cause me anxiety and fear) I found her reactions forced and poorly timed As in William or Dylan does something cutepauseHAHAHA from K with dimples and a playful arm jab Like a minute too late What? And she cannot match Cillian Murphys intensity He somehow manages to really look at her and look as though he is fascinated by her and falling in love with her whereas she seems totally disconnected almost like she is interacting with a mirror That must be torture acting opposite someone who isnt delivering the same level of energy as you Know what else is torture? This moviebr br Knightly does look stunning during her cyclical Ive got 1940s pin curls and a hot dress Watch me sing! shots but whats the point? Is she an altar or an actress? When she talks its bizarre Ooow Mehster Deelan Whur eer ya going? This makes me confused because the accent is so mixed up and unauthentic yet so thick at times I have no idea what shes saying (or maybe fell asleep) If no one knows who Vera was or cares or few do was it so important to give her this supposed Welsh accent? It distracts from all the rest of the action (just kidding there)br br This movie seems like someone dreamed a movie maybe after reading a little Dylan Thomas before bed But instead of adapting to the waking world was like Man that dream was so interesting and tried to replicate it Then someone else cautioned Your script needs work Nothing that happens furthers a story or creates necessity and the writer is all But thats the way I dreamed it! Its like the rambling fantasy of a child one of those wild and meandering yarns they spin to get your attention And THEN William went to a war and then Vera had a baby and then some blond chick drank too much and there were so many airplanes and pin curls and everyone had ruby red lips andbr br As for the Dylan Thomas character (so bland thats all I can call him) why didnt he have any lines in this goofy biopic? All he does is drink beer and smoke cigarettes and roll around with Sienna Miller who is so wild and artistic shell do a cartwheel in public! Get outta here you crazy poets! (I realize she is not a poet but she and Thomas are like this one nauseating unit of crazy guys havin crazy times like a lukewarm Sailor and Lula from Wild at Heart) Someone asks in the message board if they should buy this film I say do it Leave it on your shelf and only utilize it as a weapon to narcotize children the elderly or lingering house guestsbr br PS to Murphys characterwhen someone asks if you were in the sh you can say yes because your war scenes appear to have been shot at a landfill
After I saw this I concluded that it was most likely a chick flick; afterward I found out that Keiras mother wrote the screenplay so that pretty much confirmed it However a chick flick can have some appeal to men; this one does not and really seems not to appeal that well either to women (looking at the dismal box office receipts) One item that I believe both genders agree upon is the stupidity of the the scene in the movie whereby an analogy is made between the pain of childbirth to the pain of a limb being amputated wo anesthesia Though men do not undergo the pain of childbirth we understand that it is a painful process; yet it is a natural pain whereas an amputation certainly is not! Women understand this even better I suspect some woman was trying to make a feminist statement that is in poor taste In fact a lot of things in this movie are in very poor taste Though movies nowadays are known for having poor taste this one really excels in that department This could have been a good movie that shows the struggles of Dylan Thomas during WWII; and how strong the sentiment was against men who somehow managed to avoid serving in the military then Keiras screen writing mother tries to show how this sentiment was used against Dylan but really muddles this Instead we get a chick flick about how two young mothers bond together; sort of In a way Perhaps Somehow Of note is the fact that a soldier (the husband of the friend of Dylans wife) is sent back home after serving in combat; yet it is unclear if the war has ended!! A lot of things about this movie are similarly unclear; and though I have stated that already I will do so again as it seems to be the central motif of this mess
An odd willfully skewed biopic of Dyan Thomas in which we hear little more than a dozen lines of his poetry Instead we have to endure a raw character exposée seen through the prism of his proto-bigamous relationship with wife (Sienna Miller) and childhood love (Keira Knightley) Matthew Rhys plays Thomas with sufficient charm to inoculate us against his otherwise repellent self-interest and Cillian Murphy makes up the persistently tense lovetetbr br The film never seems to decide on where its going Theres no arc so much as a viaduct from one end of the war to the other Maybury seems much more interested in his two female leads (who wouldnt!?) than in the man who brings them together and then divides them Miller is the choice of the two (I found Knightley competent at best but then I have never found her sympathetic) but they both offer dreadfully inconsistent Welsh accents Other funny decisions include too much for the inconsequential character of William (Murphy) arty production (eg double crossfades) that is neither impressionist nor symbolic and the old chestnut act of period footage which doesnt blend 410
This movie is actually so poor in its desperate attempts at being feel good and casual it really made me embarrassed watching it I cant imagine how the inner circle of Norwegian celebs and press must have felt trying to pretend to like it at the star-packed premiere Its great media reviews is a sickening example of how ridiculously small and inbred the Norwegian media scene is Had a foreign film of this quality reached the silver screen it would have gotten the rain of rotten tomatoes it truly deservesbr br The combination of literally amateur actors home-made style visual effects awkward dialogue painfully idle attempts at working class humour and the overly cozy and meaningless plot really makes this a movie of rock bottom quality Stay away
This is one of the most awful movies Ive ever seen probably only surpassed by the dreadful and utterly meaningless Blueberry How can Harald Zwart even have put his name on this crap Im feeling every ounce of respect I had for him waning fastbr br So what is it about this film that makes it so poor? Is it the story? Yes Is it the actors? Yes It it the whole look and feel of the movie? Yesbr br To start off with the story my god!Its about as cliché-ridden and predictable as what you would expect from a drunk 14-year old who is late writing hisher paper on What I did this summer The feel-good vibe the makers try to achieve just completely drown as we suffer through yet another embarrassing turn to the storybr br The actors are amateurs I know and thus we cannot expect them to be of the same quality as professional actors But for this to work the characters HAVE to be charming andor funny (preferably both) so that the viewers dont mind the cheeky acting or perhaps it even adds to the characters In this case not even close baby! You start off disliking the characters mildly and by the end of the film (I think its about 90 minutes long although it feels like 4 hours) you have a strong desire to hurt somebody to get your mind of these annoying stupid guys! It should be impossible to find this movies attempt at humor successful unless youre actually yourself like these stupid hickeys Their before mentioned lack of talent and credibility as far as acting goes only makes the foolish and overly simple scenes fall harder to the ground Even the family of the people involved will have a hard time finding this anything but very very embarrassing (Id rather have my sister make a fool of herself on American Idol)br br Finally why cram in a bunch of misplaced Norwegian celebrities? They look even more out of place than the actors if this is possible These celebrity cameos just add to the cheap feeling of the film and is in itself a pretty see-through shot in the dark at trying to improve something broken even before inceptionbr br I cannot even begin to stress how much Id rather watch paint dry than ever watch this movie again
I think I watched a highly edited version because it wasnt nearly as graphic as I expected - based on the other reviews that I have heardbr br Other than 1 being written by the same person who wrote the original Emmanuelle (1974) Emmanuelle Arsan 2 the lead character being a sexually free spirit and 3 being set in the exotic locale of Asia Laure doesnt have the same flair as its predecessorbr br I just found this film way too talky with philosophical topics that Im really not that interested in ie the voyeuristic open relationship between Laure and Nick Im just happy with whatever brings her pleasuresomething along those lines I cannot relate to this mentality and the filmcharacters dont really shed any lightbr br The second half about finding the Mara tribe just seemed as though it were a completely separate film One that I didnt care for By that time I was just hoping that it would turn into a porn so that at least it would keep my interestbr br Maybe I just didnt get itbr br Ill leave it at that
There were so many classic movies that were made where the leading people were out-and- out liars and yet they are made to look good I never bought into that stuff The screwball comedies were full of that stuff and so were a lot of the Fred Astaire filmsbr br Here Barbara Stanwyck plays a famous country magazine writer who has been lying to the public for years and feels she has to keep lying to keep her persona (and her job) She even lies to a guy about getting married another topic that was always trivialized in classic filmsbr br Shes a New York City woman who pretends shes a great cook and someone who knows how to handle babies etc Obviously she knows nothing and the lies pile up so fast you lose track I guess all of that is supposed to be funny because lessons are learned in the end and true love prevails etc etc Please pass the barf bagbr br Most of this film is NOT funny Stanwyck was far better in the film noir genre As for Dennis Morgan well pass the bag again
Oh God! It could be a very interesting film and in fact it is I would have like to give it a 5 but i give a 2 for my vote Why? I saw it in a theatre! See this film on DVD or on TV! The shooting is really really POOR!!!!! It keeps shaking all the time in a completely tasteless framing!br br Its really painful to see this very interesting film in a cinema You got quickly seasick and you have to make some huge effort not to puke on your neighbor s seat! br br Its really a shame cos the story is edited in a non-linear way which is quite rare (and a very good idea!) for a documentary br br Watch this at home!
As noted in other comments here the camera-work is laughably bad I am tempted to say that the director of photography is a 7-year-old but that would be mean -- to 7-year-oldsbr br Okay but what about the subject? I was looking for some insight into the state of the wine industry worldwide you know Mondovino What the film is about is a very narrow view of one intrigue in that world: the struggle between Mondavi and the French and Italian wineries that they would like to buy There is no enlightening narration that would put the whole deal into context so we are left with the selective process of the director and the interviews with the various characters in this little psychodrama Theres no shortage of despicable characters or even despicable dogs in sight There is a shortage of evenhandedness however br br Is the director a Marxist? I wondered as I tried to maintain some semblance of focus as the camera dipped swerved zoomed in a chaotic flourish Small grower in France: good Huge grower in USA: very very bad Forget about the hundreds of small wineries throughout North America Australia and South America There is a dead horse to beat here for over two hoursbr br To learn about the intrigue more you are better off reading about it elsewhere And you will be able to sample your favorite wine without feeling sick while doing sobr br I suggest a new award at Cannes for Best America-bashing Diatribe
Was it really necessary to include embarrassing footage of non-participants in a documentary And why all the silly dog scenes and then repetition of all the same silly dog scenes? This film starts with a great promise - to expose the international politics and the business of wine It got off to a great start and included all the right characters But the production is a mess Points started and developed most of the way then never finished or left with dangling ends Very poor and disorienting camera work and editing They should have used subtitles for the British mumbler from Christiesbr br Too much fluff and not enough fact for a documentarybr br Probably honored at Cannes because of the US bashing (although in my opinion there was too little of it)br br We left at the 2:00 hour mark - I have no idea how much longer it ran on
Ive heard people compare this movie to Sideways How this comparison was made Ill never guess because this movie was in no way comparable to Sidewaysbr br These 2 films were as different as Star Wars and the Thornbirds The only thing they had in common at all was they both had wine as a subjectbr br Though the interviews in this documentary were semi-interesting they were ruined by the absolute worst camera work everattempted Ive never seen worse camera work in my life and Im comparing it to home videos accidentally taken by 5 year oldsbr br I give this two stars ONLY for the interesting interviews with French wine types and for showing how pushy and corrupt the American wine companies are (Arent all companies pushy and corrupt?) Id give it -10 stars (Yes thats NEGATIVE 10) for the deplorable terrible horrible awful VERTIGO-INDUCING 5-year-old-could-do-better camera mess
i was looking forward to this and to be honest there were some bright spots but it would have worked better if it had concentrated on one story rather than shooting all over the world The many dogs were a lot of fun but i got bored of the wine fascists pompously whining (;-)) on about their achievementsbr br I felt it would have worked better as an hour long TV documentary concentrating on one of the many different issues it explored The most interesting being the french town near montpelier fighting off a an American wine companys campaign to get rid of the historic forests A socialist mayor agreed to a deal a nicely timed election arrived and a communist mayor was elected who turned it down much to the exasperation of the American wine execsbr br hopefully the directors cut will be shorter than the original
The filmmakers try to paint the influence of the Mondovis and Robert Parker as a travesty on par with the German occupation of France and the reign of Fascism But they never find a victim in this film We hear wine makers critics and distributors bemoan that while the wine industry grows it becomes increasingly homogeneous But the film never makes a case that this has resulted in the loss of any good wine or exploitation of any person or culture other than naive Wine Spectator readers with lots of cash If they want to pay hundreds of dollars for a dull wine so be itbr br If this were a film about the diamond trade where the DeBeers corporations market domination results in human suffering the muckraking style might have been appropriate But as it is it just comes off as anti-American anti-modernization and anti-capitalist Had the filmmakers been around in the 1870s they most likely would have protested the grafting of American vines in the effort to save French wine
The film is annoyingbr br Technically there are too many times you see unfocused and very roughly edited scenes One could easily get a cleaner film using a decent amateur camera and 100$ video editing software Down to earth man on the street doesnt mean sloppy editing Unfocused scenes that dont contain important statement should have been deleted The same goes for making sure that the objects headhandothers stay in the frame My 8 years old son knows that by nowbr br The film is way too long The main point (anti globalization) is understood after 30 minutes why bother with all the rest After the interview with James Suckling I pressed the stop button What a waist of timebr br The main theme just doesnt work for me anymore Ive seen too many small wineries which produce mediocre commercialized wines and many big wineries that produce great and unique wines The movie identifies the small producers as the ones that are producing wines with more Identity or terroir The bigger ones are accused of producing internationalized or commercialized wines The film is trying to make a black and white statement in a world full of gray tones However the movie hasnt proved this claim They look at a couple of sporadic examples tie some of the big producers (Frescobaldi) with fascism and provided interviews with key people Well did all the small producers spent WWII in the resistance? Is it relevant to see that Parker has a thing with Bulldogs? The movie is very manipulative and unconvincing
i do not understand at all why this movie received such good grades from critics - - ive seen tens of documentaries (on TV) about the wine world which were much much better when (if) you watch it please think of two very annoying aspects of mondovino : first the filming is just awful and terrible and upsetting : to me it looked like the guy behind the camera just received the material and was playing with it : plenty of zooms (for no purpose other than pushing the button inout) for instance - - i almost stopped to watch it because of that ! secondly the interviewer (the director i think) is not really relevant : he looks like and ask questions like a boy scout not like a journalist even if the general idea and themes would have been interesting too bad conclusion: overrated documentary maybe only for guys who do not know nothing about wine = not recommended at all (210)
Did Beavis and Butthead make this movie? It is just that bad Truly an uneven and unfair portrayal of bad vs good in the wine world Did you notice the filmmaker trying any of the wines from the featured protectors of individual wines and terroir The camera work is dizzying at best while the content may put you to sleep before long This is not insightful journalism What I got from this movie was that the filmmaker was trying hard to make a point about the globalism of wine by showing for example that the Mondavi family owned wineries in all parts of the world Okay that is a good start So how do these wines compare? Does the Mondavi Napa cab taste like their Italian wines We never find out because no one in the film comments on this Instead there is a lot of innuendo about Nazis and fascism Well those things dont grow grapes Hmmmm
This film appears to be an exposé of the current trend towards globalization and homogenization in the wine industry Wineries around the world are more and more either joining large conglomerates (the American producer Mondavi in the case of this film) or paying high-priced experts to help them make the perfect wine--and as a result wines are becoming very standard and predictable To some this is a good thing (especially since few can afford to pay $50 or more for an everyday wine) and to others this is horrible as the uniqueness of smaller wineries is disappearing I truly can understand the concerns of both sides and dont think there is a villain or hero in this business Sure good and cheaper wine is a nice thing but like whats happened with beers (with giants like Unibrew and Anheiser-Busch) food (McDonalds) shopping (European shopping malls are almost indistinguishable from American ones) and mega-stores (like WalmartAsda) are taking away much of the uniqueness of the little guys So I definitely was ready and willing to listen to these film makers However with a product that is almost two and a half hours long AND a general lack of focus the film simply became too big a chore to watch and I lost interest An 80-90 minute focused film would have been MUCH more effective--especially since the average viewer is NOT an oenophile (thats the high-brow word for a wine aficionado)br br On the very positive side the film makers are smart not to do much talking at all--and simply let those on both sides of the issue do the talking Plus the topic is so relevant and timely However despite choosing a good style of documentary making the film simply goes on way way way too long and ended up making a very dull film

He who fights with monsters might take care lest he thereby become a monster And if you gaze for long into an abyss the abyss gazes also into youbr br Yes this is from Nietzsches Aphorism 146 from Beyond Good and Evil And thats what you find at the start of this moviebr br If you watch the whole movie you will doubt if it was the message that the Ram Gopal Varma Production wanted to pass on As the scenes crop up one by one quite violent and at times puke-raking the viewer is expected to forget the Nietzsche quote and think otherwise That to deal with few people you need dedicated people like Sadhu Agashe who will have the licence to kill anyone not just writing FIRs (something unworthy of the police to do as we are made to believe)br br When TADA was repealed and the government wanted to pass newer and even more draconian laws RGVs Satya did the required brain surgery without blood transfusion for the multiplex growing thinking urban crowd whose views matters in a democratic country like India Within a year MCOCA was passedbr br When real life encounter specialist Daya Nayak became a monster on the path of fighting them and was himself booked by MCOCA Aab tak Chhappan was made to heed out false impression among the people about this With its you have to be a monster to save your nation approachbr br And people consumed it No questions raised Only praises and hopes that they get a Sadhu Agashe in their local police station who will solve all problems and hence let only milk and butter flow all over Blood?

This movie is not at all like City of God you might get the same feeling but it isnt theres no intense shooting nor intense drug scenes you get the idea If you ask me I think this film was a waste of time there are a lot of other films which gives 100 times better meaning and teaching than Wooden Camera Yes I might be the only one to give a negative comment for this film but its only in my opinion Its one of those films where I can get the feeling that Ill be blown away but when the credits start to role my friends and I all gave mutual looks and we all laughed at how ridiculous this movie was So to conclude this matter I advise not to watch itbr br Personal note - Making Africans talk English was a big mistake In City of God they used their native language which gave the film much more power and reality
Dont get me wrong I really love the arena-martial arts genre and I get more and more surprised over how many films like this there are out there This one is one of those and its not even close to be one of the best With Mathias Hues in it I thought it would be good He cant save this movie though and to be honest he wasnt very good either Just dont pay attention to what other people say; The fighting scenes in this movie are NOT good at all I really know what Im talking about since I have seen so many movies like this There are also a bunch of scenes that have absolutely nothing to do with the plot whatsoever I guess they added these only to make the movie last a little bit longer in addition to manifest the bad guy asuuuuuuhbad (like we didnt know that already)
I laughed so much when I saw this film I nearly soiled myself ! Awful acting laughable effects (super imposed explosions) and dodgy slow motion fightingbr br One of the worst films Ive ever seen !
and I still dont know where the hell this movie is going? I mean really what is this movie about? Is it about demonstrating Sean Connerys complete lack of Arabic? Is it about showing that if he could play the role of a Moroccan warlord then he was a natural to play the role of Ramirez in highlander? Why was Teddy Roosevelt even in this movie? Why was there so much sand that was put to so little use? Where was there so much table slapping? Why did Teddy ignore the Japanese guy who he was shooting archery with? Did he realize the man was Japanese? Why was no no credible excuse given for Connerys accent? At least Jean Claude Van Damme has an excuse for his French accent whether it be being raised by French nuns in Hong Kong (Double Impact) being raised on the bayou in Louisiana (Universal Soldier) or having a French mother and being raised in Indochina (I cannot even remember the name of that movie)? Can anyone explain this?
Luscious Candace Bergen as a prim Victorian beauty kidnapped by Sean Connery as a devilish desert Sheikh! How can you go wrong? How? Oh let me count the ways!!! Earthy primitive Sean Connery exactly the right man to tame a brittle classy beauty like Candace is    well underwhelming in the role Thats because instead of having dialog about the real issues (you are a woman    I am a man!) he has to babble nonsense about the will of Allah and the wind blows destiny across the desert sands John Milius a director known more for the worship of naked male bodies and brute military force than any insight (or interest) in conventional human relationships has a maddening way of cutting away from his desert lovers every time it looks like Candace might get kissed Instead of watching nature take its course with two fabulously attractive people in a picturesque landscape we are treated to endless (and I do mean ENDLESS) shots of Brian Keith flashing his walrus sized choppers and delivering gritty sermons on the joys of being Teddy Roosevelt I have nothing against Teddy Roosevelt but watching him test out his new rifle or make speeches about the heroic death of a big bear just doesnt excite me the way the love story between Candace Bergen and Sean Connery would have    if it had ever actually gotten underway! The weird thing is Milius spends most of his time building up characters and story lines that have no resolution Candaces two little children in the story both get more screen time than she does Theres no humor no chemistry no sizzle in any of the things that happen to her in the desert Unless you think its funny that after weeks of galloping around on horseback her hair is still perfectbr br The only real moment in the story is when late at night Candace Bergen shakes her little daughter out of a sound sleep on soft cushions and says we must escape The little girl turns over and without missing a beat replies but mother I was sleeping! That one line sums up whats really missing from the story No danger suspense or sizzle in the basic story line of a cultivated lady in captivity She (and her children) are both so snug and well cared for that its hard to believe anyone is worked up about their fatebr br Mind you if Candace herself had said the line it might have worked better If the tension came from her enjoyment of her captivity (or her delight at being in the arms of Sean Connery) and her guilt about all the trouble being caused by her abduction then the story would have had some tension But Milius makes the odd assumption that the audience is just as worked up as he is over whether Teddy Roosevelt will get the chance to prove his manhood three thousand miles away In the end the pretty lady and her children dont seem to matter worth a damn to him    and since theyre at the center of the story the whole thing seems rather dry and endless    like the burning desert sands
In 1904 Tangier a wealthy American woman and her two children are kidnapped by Berbers murderous desert pirates who scorn the Moroccan government and by doing so kidnap American pestilence which attracts the attention of US President Theodore Roosevelt Fictitious historical epic is less a grand adventure than it is a peculiar somewhat exhaustive throwback to the desert-sheik films of the 1940s (with a bit of The King and I interjected besides) Portraying the cloaked mustachioed bloodthirsty leader and his snippy haughty captive Sean Connery and Candice Bergen could be acting in two entirely different movies (neither one seems to know how far to carry the camp-elements of their characters and dialogue and both seem singularly without proper direction) The various (and anonymous) slashings and beheadings which occur are arbitrary: we dont know any of these victims and the big action scenes become blurry noisy montages of sand-swept violence on horseback The pluses: a much-lauded music score by Jerry Goldsmith (Oscar-nominated but a loser to John Williams Jaws) fine location shooting and cinematography 12 from 
Lets not fool ourselves okay? We all know that this film was made because of the success of the Grumpy Old Men movies Unlike those however this travesty has zero humor and very little heartbr br Gloria DeHaven is the sole shining light to be seen It breaks my heart that she was finally given the chance to show off her skills to a new generation of moviegoers only to end up in a piece of dreck such as this There was a touching scene which featured her being stood up by someone she was falling in love with Her fine performance was the only quality acting going on in Out To Sea Everyone else is just going through the motions 210
I never heard of this film when it first came out It must have sunk immediately :o) I saw it on cable while sick in hospital so I hardly had enough energy to watch it let alone turn the channel Better choice than the Style Channel ;0( Filmed on location this travelogue should have been on the Travel Channel The plot is recycled from ship board farces of the thirties and forties The cast seems to have been recycled from the fifties Donald OConnor star of musicals and Edward Mulhare as a card shark As to the main cast Walter Matthau is still playing the same part as he did in Guys and Dolls or was it the one about the orphan girl? Wiseacre irresponsible gambler and rounder But it just doesnt take with a man of his age As to Jack Lemmon he plays his part so straight he can hardly dip and glide when dancing And as mentioned Dyan Cannon is outstandingly attractive as another swindler sailing with her mother who thinks Walter is rich while he thinks she is rich Elaine Stritch plays Dyans mother another retread from the fifties The most fun is the running feud between Brent Spiner as the domineering and snotty cruise director who immediately spots Walter as a poor dancer and spends his time trying to get him dismissed so he will have to pay for his free passage In the end though he receives his comeuppances Meanwhile Jack mopes about meets an attractive woman with mutual attraction but their affair is broken up by Walters lies that Jack is a doctor when he was actually a retired department store buyer But finally the two men take to the sea in a rubber boat to intercept her seaplane and all is well There does not seem to be any principal player under the age of fifty
Sadness was the emotion I felt after the screen went dark Puzzled was another Why would two seasoned screen vets like Matthau and Lemmon sign on to this putrid project? Im under the impression they didnt read the script before the cameras started rolling All the cast is wasted in this unfunny uninteresting and unimpressive movie Sadly enough this was one of elegant Edward Mulhares last projects here as the heavy Dyan Cannon tries Hal Linden looks bored Donald Oconnor reciting a few lines laden with profanity (??!!) Im not with the Legion of Decency My point is they were spouted purely for the strangeness of hearing him use off-color language That is a desperate attempt to infuse humor into a picture He actually did deliver the films only morsel of entertainment when he pattered about on the dancefloor though I save my harshest criticism for the leads Walter Matthau should have known better He still delivers great solo performances (IQ Dennis The Menace etc) His character although affable is rather dull and one dimensional Seen him once seen him all Jack Lemmon gives another one of his trademark weepy just too darn sensitive male portrayals When he starts that mode I vicariously want to hand him a box of tissues OUT TO SEA is painfully unfunny and whoever produced this mess should be made to walk the plank
hair the movie based on the broadway hitfails to achieve any redeemable cinematic qualities you cant really take the play and make it a movie whether one is so tempted by the rock music to see this movie it really detracts from the quality of a broadway show worse than seeing sitcom reruns musical fiasco and cant believe others rated it so high
This film is an insult to the play upon which it is based The character of Claude has been warped beyond recognition leaving a painful performance that does not even vaguely resemble the original plot Shame shame shame They have also cut a fair number of the original score of change the context in which the songs are sung This warps the air of the film and causes the viewer who is aware of how this should be to wince as the writer of this screen play gives Hud a wifeturns Sheila into a spoiled rich girl characterizes Claude as a cowboy and kills Burger by sending him to Vietnam instead If one is not familiar with the original plot I assure you this is not a bad film for you to see but if you ever wish to see the original or are as I am a die-hard fan of the classic play you would do best to avoid the film altogether One really must stick to one or the other
I should start off by saying I have something of a love-hate relationship with musicals Some of them are fantastic some are downright crap So I expected Hair to fall into one of those categories However it didnt falling instead in the middlebr br The songs arent brilliant though the Sodomy song did make me smile a lot and everything is rather dated looking But the movie didnt draw me in as others have such as Rocky Horror Although thats a bad example since for years I hated Rocky Horror then all of a sudden I got it and have loved it ever since Maybe Hair will be the same Although I doubt it will get as much exposure as Rocky Horror due to the language and nudity content so I doubt I will get the chance to have it grow on me Gettit? Hairgrowoh suit yourselfbr br Anyhow I didnt get to see the last fifteen minutes or so due to a technical glitch which was a shame since I would have liked to see how it ended especially after reading some of the reviews herebr br Not a film for the casual cinema-goer but definitely one for musical lovers I really hope they dont re-make it though since I think any such re-make would end up a shallow pale PC version of the originalbr br Worth a look for lovers of the genre
Ive liked Milos Formans movies since I saw One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest and Amadeus (two big masterpieces) but when I saw Hair I kept wondering if this was the same Milos Forman This movie is boring and uninteresting to say the least OK the music is pretty good but on screen it only seems like a bunch of drugged people dancing around (wait a minute thats what it really is!) In fact the only interesting part and the only part where Milos talent shows up are the last 15 minutes or so (SPOILER!!) since when Berger takes Claudes place as a soldier set to the Vietnam war That 15 minutes are moving and well-directed but its a shame that we have to endure so much awful material before thatbr br Well maybe this is one of those movies you need to be on the subject to enjoy (the subject being marijuana acid and other drugs the film glorifies) Im not so
I was a hippie age 22 in 1965 have seen the play 5 times have 2 versions of the music and have read the script many times Maybe taken as an separate thing the movie is OK but as an adoption of the play its terriblebr br First the good The songs are sung well and the production values are pretty good The homosexual implications in Black Boys White Boys is cute The ClaudeBerger switch was interesting Hair is a fluid production and constant changes in it are inherent provided the basic spirit of it is retainedbr br But the basic spirit was very much distorted It seemed like all the producer wanted was to sing certain songs and fit the story-line to them regardless of what that did to the original intent of the playbr br Claude Sheila and Hud were presented as a selfish brats who could care less about anyone outside their tribe Claude destroyed Sheilas parents party (its hard to believe that she smiled while her parents were being hurt) and repeatedly stole cars Sheila stole the soldiers clothes and car Then she left him in the middle of the desert where he would certainly sunburn badly probably be busted in rank and could likely die on that lonely Nevada road Good fun And Hud found it fine to break his sons heart while yelling at his ex This is not what hippies were like not what the play described and is directly opposite to a love generationbr br Ive never seen a hippie beg for money The point was to be self-sufficient outside the capitalist system not beg from itbr br After Berger is thrown in jail for ruining Sheilas party and Claude offers to bail some out Berger insists on being bailed instead with no better plan for bailing the rest that hitting on Sheilas parents and then hitting on his own mommybr br Be In has always been a very spiritual point but here it is wasted on silly brides floating around Even if this is part of his trip it ruins a beautiful song I know theyre contrasting Floating In Space with the Army But again it totally ruins a beautiful songbr br While Sheila and Claude are skinny dipping Berger steals their clothes laughing it was fun man even after he could see both were very annoyed Then a little later Berger does one thing that no hippie ever does He hits Claude Terriblebr br Then they have the perfect opportunity to sing Starshine at night in some beautiful SF spot with the stars twinkling down maybe working into an inventive duet Instead the whole tribe sings it in the blazing sun speeding down the road in a convertible (stolen of course)br br I was vastly disappointed with the movie in 1979 and I like it even less now I think it would have been possible to do a reasonably close adoption of the show but this aint it
When a friend once lambasted me for my first movie (a pretty bad videotaped affair) I argued that I could grow; Orson Welles first movie indeed was even worse He challenged me that it couldnt be so I pulled out the Criterion laserdisc of (I think) CITIZEN KANE and played HEARTS OF AGE My friend lasted just a few minutes before conceding the pointbr br There is a little humor in this short but its basically as pretentious as (and perhaps a collegiate answer to) BLOOD OF A POET and other avant garde films of the time It is what it is: a succession of images with a vague theme and unless you really enjoy any footage of Welles (in heavy makeup to boot) this isnt really even worth tracking down
Just watched on UbuWeb this early experimental short film directed by William Vance and Orson Welles Yes you read that right Orson Welles! Years before he gained fame for radios The War of the Worlds and his feature debut Citizen Kane Welles was a 19-year-old just finding his muse Besides Vance and Welles another player here was one Virginia Nicholson who would become Orsons first wife She plays a woman who keeps sitting on something that rocks back and forth courtesy of an African-American servant (Paul Edgerton in blackface) During this time a man (Welles) keeps passing her by (courtesy of the scene constantly repeating) I wont reveal any more except to say how interesting the silent images were as they jump-cut constantly Thats not to say this was any good but it was fascinating to watch even with the guitar score (by Larry Morotta) added in the 2005 print I watched Worth a look for Welles enthusiasts and anyone with a taste of the avant-garde
I was at Wrestlemania VI in Toronto as a 10 year old and the event I saw then was pretty different from what I saw on the Wrestlemania Collection DVD I just watched I dont understand how the wwE doesnt have the rights to some of the old music since most of those songs were created by the WWF they shouldnt have to worry about the licensing and royalty fees that prevent shows like SNL from releasing season sets Its pretty stupid to whine about but for me hearing Demolition come out to their theme music at a Wrestlemania in person was a memory that I never forgot and it didnt exist on this DVD What is the point of them even owning the rights to this huge library of video if they have to edit it so drastically to use it?
This movie despite its list of B C and D list celebs is a complete waste of 90 minutes The plot with its few peaks was very predictable It was so silly that I cannot believe that I am taking the time to even write a review of it Flex to his credit has grown in his ability to act since playing Michael Jackson in a made for TV movie a few years ago Tangi on the other hand has regressed as she was more talented in her role as Felicitys flunkie some years ago As I sat watching this train wreck of a film with its pitiful production and horrible sound quality other four letter words came to my mind to qualify what I thought of this film However in an effort to keep my writings G Rated Ill simply say this film is another four letter word starting with an L LAME!!!
This looks so good on paper - Matt Damon Lawrence Fishbourne Jean Reno nice right? And a heist with $42 million - sounds like a kick-ass crime moviebr br Big disappointment - I reckon the stars got all the money because the production values on this are lousybr br But more than that it the pseudo reservoir Dogs atmosphere when the easy crime goes wrong Its very much made for TV stuffbr br All in all hugely disappointing - it score points for being what it is - but loses them massively for being bluntly not very interesting at all
Armoredbr br The best part about driving an armored vehicle is that if any bums approach you at a red light asking for money you can shoot them in the facebr br And while the armoured guards in this thriller arent using their protective power to purge the drifter population they are using their position to fleece their employerbr br When newcomer Ty (Columbus Short) lands a job with an armored trunk company he feels like he has found his lot in life Unfortunately however when he discovers that his co- workers (Matt Dillon Jean Reno and Laurence Fishburne) are plotting to take the $42 M shipment for themselves Ty must fortify himself  and the funds  inside the armored truckbr br A tedious caper with a plodding plot and phoned-in performances Armored is an utterly forgettable filmbr br Besides if you really want to jack millions its a lot simpler to just disguise yourself as an ATM (Red Light)
Well where do we start there was a lot of potential for this film with such big stars playing a role But the whole story was ruined by a horrific plot This movie did not pan out to be what i would expect the good guy makes it out alive i mean co mon nobody wants the good guy to be successful The ending was cringe worthy and very cliché no thought what so ever YOU GOT THE PLOT ALL WRONG THE BAD GUYS ARE MEANT TO COME OUT SUCCESSFULbr br If you want to waste 1 hour and 2 minutes of your time spend it doing something else this movie was the epitome of CRAP I really think the actors did this movie for some quick Vegas cash no doubt about it SAVE your money watch a better movie
What a bad movie the premise was all there the actors were all there And yet a believable plot good dialogue characters to relate to were somewhat missingbr br Typical heist gone wrong premise set against a backdrop of everyman being shafted by the system The lead character Tye and his little brother have been having no luck and their house is going to be repossessed along comes godfather Matt Dillon (Who does not look much older than Tye so not exactly sure how that happened)to the rescue with a plan to steal money from an armoured van which they work on as security guards Tye has a brief flirtation with a conscience but decides to go along with it And thus begins a truly awful hole ridden 30 minutes of unbelievable trash I will not list all the ways in which this movie was unrealistic but let me point out the major ones:br br Because of Tye deciding to be a good guy because a homeless guy became collateral damage all of his close friends including his godfather die His godfather who is supposedly family and the man who brought him into the caper at the last minute to help him out dies because of Tye Tye in the process of thwarting his friends and godfather destroys all the money The money came from the same bank that was repossessing his house And yet he chose it over the supposed family of Matt Dillonbr br There are many more needless to say that this film was tripe and I earnestly hope nobody else goes to see it
A heist film with Jean Reno Matt Damon and Laurence Fishburne sounds great on paper? I suspect it must have done when someone green lighted the production of this movie but the end product is terrible!br br The story is dull the action boring and for a film that is only 88 minutes it seems to just drag on I could feel my life slipping away and was sure there was something better I should have been doing any paint to watch dry somewhere perhaps?br br Sigh Im a huge fan of Jean Reno but what on earth was he thinking when he signed up to this? There are so many other great action movies around go watch one of those and let this movie be best forgotten
The sounds in the movie were so mundane and ridiculous seriously banging on the door hinges for about 30 minutes really crunches your teeth and makes your head hurtbr br i love bad puns more than the next guy but come on no blood on our hands being said about a million times by Matt Dillon character and when Matt Dillons character shoots the bum the lead character which i fail to remember his name because i dont really think anyone cares gets blood on his hands literallybr br the background music with the heavy metal guitar ringing an A-chord for about 5 minutes isnt my idea of music come on i was having the worst headache by the end of this garbage
The film had it moments but was disappointing in my eyes anyway It was a reworking of Trespass (Walter Hill) and so The Treasure Of the Sierra Madre with less tension bite and human emotion There was some nice acting but the story was limp and lacked any real depth I watched the movie for Mr Reno and Mr Fishburn neither were inspired and both had little to say or act out of their skin for This movie has been done to death in the past and did not have to be made eats up money which could be used on better movies For an action movie it was sparse of action and as a thriller did not thrill Better than watching snow fall but not for me
Dillon Fishbourne Reno should have teamed up for a much smarter effort because this one slides in the B-Category and could have been done with no-name actors and a much smaller budget since anyway 2 armored trucks and a wasted warehouse could not have coasted too much Since the writers did not manage to come with a smart heist plan they targeted the dramatics of the situation but there was not much to exploit there either Fishbourne and Reno do not bring anything to this movie except the media interest theyre only expensive advertising Dillon is OK but this was a walk in the park The choices of the main character Ty Hackett are quite uninspired and the final with the reward is quite childish Waste of time money actors and so on
One of those movies in which there are no big twists whatsoever and you can predict pretty much whats is going to happen Matt dillon was awesome once again but the rest didnt played a bigger part as they should havebr br It was exciting in the beginning but kinda slow paced and predictable in the endIts one of those flicks in which the good guy wins no matter happensIf you have absolutely nothing to do you can give it a try I personally found it not worth watching The story could have been more interesting and the director could have made it less of a B-movie by engineering a happy ending
After watching this for 15 minutes I knew how it would end Its a cliché film with a stupid setup Im a big fan of thief films but this one does not deliver anything new smart or special Its about an insider heist gone bad because hot head-bad guy shots a bum and of course do goody-bad guy goes on a moral trip The reason why its stupid and not believable is When youve already gone so far to kill a bum why not just kill the one guy that stands between you and 43 million They got 45 minutes to stash the money and stage a robbery nobody in there right mind would hesitate to shoot Mr do goody and in this case he is a guy they known for a few days All and all I was leaning to fast forwarding from the middle of it but I duked it out and boy do I regret it
Disappointing heist movie indeed I was actually expecting a pretty cool cat and mouse stuff going on through out the movie and it does have few of those cat and mouse stuff going on but it was just pretty stupid And it basically showed all the good scenes in the trailer as a matter of fact if you seen the trailer to this you basically seen the whole film cause it is just that predictable So basically the plot is about a few armored truck company workers that try to steal the 42 million dollars they are suppose to transport until one of the members grows a conscience I thought the movie would be better with its cast of well known actors but I was wrong I mean this isnt necessarily a bad film but it just wasnt that good either or has any depth This is most definitely a rental at best just not really worth seeing it in theaters heist br br 4810
OK I for one thought the trailer was quite good so was hopeful for this film plus with the cast line up I was sure it couldnt get less than a 6 in my books However I got annoyed half hour into the story just where normal films get good this film hit rock bottom br br SPOILER  The guy who everyone is trying to help is so caring of other people getting hurt in the middle of the hustle that he turns on his colleagues to save a tramp and then locks himself inside one of the armoured trucks Not only that he constantly tries to get other peoples attention by which he ends up endangering more people and long story short the outcome is that he is responsible for not just the tramps death but also a police officer getting shot and the kidnapping of his younger brother oh and all 5 of his colleagues dying disgraced deaths br br But in the end he is HAPPY because he came to his senses halfway through the endeavour so what if all his colleagues are now dead rather than sticking to the plan and being a millionaire This film tried to be so politically correct it makes me sick! Ruined a good story Shame really
this movie is sooooo bad that it forced me to create an account with IMDb just to warn others about itbr br i have been using IMDb for a long time and many movies have come close to making me want to register to either praise or bash them however none have ever been that worthy Until now! br br I am a huge Matt Dillon fan all i could ask myself throughout this movie is how did Dillon choose this script? really i mean there are holes in it larger than Vredefort br br i mean it is a modern day heist movie not one set in the seventies For crying out loud even a child knows that armored trucks have gps tracking and the sort makes you wonder what it takes to get a script produced in Hollywoodbr br i could go on for ages but i wont believe me when i say this save yourself the time and give this a skipbr br Sorry Matt Im still a fan but this movie sucked
A new guard in in the armored truck gig is recruited by his co-workers to steal 42 million from the truck No bad guys so no one will get hurt right? Of course things go wrong and the new guard decides to have a conscience and make things right by saving the life of a dying manbr br Ill admit that I didnt really have any interest in this film but I didnt have any interest in Fantastic Mr Fox either and that film made my top ten of the year Armored is even more of a disappointment then I thought it would be As a heist film it fails to deliver the goods its boring and full of plot holes and leaps in logic that one will hurt themselves thinking about itbr br Despite this the film somehow has a really great cast but the film doesnt even use this to its advantage Everyone seems wasted in wooden characters that make stupid choices Columbus Short is an uninteresting lead that is never charismatic and never makes the audience want to give a crap Matt Dillon is the mastermind behind the heist and he plays Mr Nice Guy at first then when things dont go his way he quickly becomes the villain The rest of the impressive cast include Lawrence Fisburn Jean Reno Skeet Ulrich Fred Ward Amaury Nolasco from Prison Break and Milo Ventimiglia from Heros Non of them do much and when they actually do something its without much reasoning behind itbr br The film is relatively short but even with its running time under 90 minutes it felt dragged out How long can you make a movie about a guy trapped somewhere? Phonebooth did a decent job and it was even more restricted The leaps of logic concerning the plot here are tragic 42 million and all the security they have are check ins every hour or so? The entire plan from my understanding was to drive the trucks into an abandoned warehouse and hide the money Pretend to get hit and burn the trucks They would then walk away with the money Of course something goes wrong or there would be no movie right? Through a series of unfortunate events out so called hero has trapped himself inside the truck with an injured officer The rest of the movie is Dillion and his crew banging on the doors to get in How very excitingbr br The script calls for our hero to have financial problems he might lose his house which would in turn make him lose his brother You see both their parents died and its just the two of them looking out for each other So now he has a reason to join the heist At first he didnt want in but his money problems is just the right push to throw him in the thick of things How convenient br br Armoreds whole spin on the heist genre is that its from an armored truck from the guys who drive it After that basic premise the film falls flat on its face I found myself wanting it to end sooner and sooner each time someone spoke Speaking of the ending it sucks br br Skip it
How do you take a cast of experienced well-known actors and put together such a stupid movie? Nimrod Antel has the answer: Armored Six co-workers at an armored car business decide to steal a large shipment of cash themselves But just as they get to first base with their plans everything unravels quickly With a plot like this youd think it couldnt be too bad at least for an action movie However in the first 40 minutes or more of this movie we see what appear to be 6 normal everyday kind of guys They joke they laugh have a few drinks together etc Then we suddenly learn theyre planning to rob their own business The hero Ty (Columbus Short) is sucked into the scheme because of the cold cruel world even though hes a decorated veteran nice guy and reliable employee Oh my oh my! Then in the last 40 minutes of the film these former regular guys nearly all turn into money-crazed psychos willing to butcher each other for cash In the last scenes Mike (Matt Dillon) goes on a suicidal rampage for no other reason than to kill his former friend The viewer has no hint before this ending that these men are this ruthless and bloodthirsty Its utterly unbelievable and B movie is almost too kind for this sort of cheesy plot I would say dont waste your time--too bad no one gave Laurence Fishburne Jean Reno or Fred Ward the same advice before making this picture
I have to admit that I am disappointed after seeing this movie I had expected so much more from the trailers The movie was absolutely horrible It lacked a real story line and the acting was not exactly the best Dont waste your time The movie is not what the trailers lead you to think it is I would have to say that I dont usually write anything about movies on IMDb (in fact this is my first one) but this movie was such a disappointment that I registered just to let people know not to waste their time or money The story line is that of a heist that is to happen and it looks like it had potential to be good but the things that happen in the movie are a little far fetched to be believable Watch another movie instead maybe the inside man???
Unbelievably disappointed The pace was slow The characters unbelievable and throughout the film as a whole just let me feel bored and unfulfilled There was no real plot that could keep you revolving around the film and keep you interested The heist itself never offered any excitement and didnt seem very well though throughbr br There was not enough depth or background to any character and Laurance Fishbournes character was one I eagerly awaited for unfortunately Laurance has no idea how to play the thuggish brut and is much preferred as a likable character Columbus short one of my favourite actors (in stomp the yard) let me down with his performance his character was dark and you could hardly see what drove his reasoningbr br The only character I think offered anything to the film was Milo Ventimiglia (Peter Petrelli in Heroes) Though his character quite small and insignificant I think his touch added to an all around dull filmbr br In Conclusion buy the DVD if you want to find a new way to waste your time
This movie is one of the worst movies I have ever seen! The cast was fantastic but the movie itself was horrible It was so awful I had to register just to say how bad it wasbr br I watched this movie and I wanted to break it every minute I watched It could have been great Had a great premise If youre going to rob an armored car and theres a homeless person which sees you you have to do what you have to do For the main character to decide to get a cop killed and kill his friends and co-workers after the homeless guy was already dead its just ridiculous And yes Im sure there will be responses to this about how his conscious got to him but come onbr br The main character crawled out the bottom of the armored truck no one saw him He blew up the stash of money and grabbed and dragged the cop right behind the other guards and no one saw him He was able to get back in the armored car and no one saw him This movie had potential but blew itbr br You couldnt pay me to watch this movie ever again! DONT EVER watch it! Aggravating
There is not much to add to what others have already commented the movie fails hard where it shouldnt it has no depth in the planning of the heist and the characters are so unbelievablebr br One thing that got me thinking was that although the rest of the gang is trying hard to remove the pins from the doors of an armored truck because there is supposed to be no other way of opening it the guy inside the truck with great ease manages to remove the floor of the truck which happens to have a hole in it so he can get out and then get back in without being noticed by anyone because no one else could think that he could get out from there or even better that they could have gotten into from therebr br Promising but not quite there
I am so angry to the point i normally down make reviews with spoilers but in this case Ill make an exceptionThe first scenes of this movies are weak and then when they get to the meat and potatoes of the movie it sucks This is one movie were i rooted for the bad guys because the captain-save-the-day was unbelievable and there was no connection to him or nothing to make you like him The lead actor gave the weakest performance and Laurence Fishburne or Matt Dillon couldnt even save this movie Sometime there are eye openers or great moments in a film that may not be that greatthis movie has none If you are looking for a movie to see in the meantime while nothing peeked your interestdont choose this onesave your money
I went to see this movie today with hopes that it would involve an at least half-intelligent story I was extremely disappointed as it did not The plot and the decisions by the main character were so far-fetched I was hoping for a Dog Day Afternoon-type movie but instead got something totally unacceptable I actually found myself totally hoping for the hero to be knocked off and I nearly walked out of the theater on several occasions when this should have happened but didnt Heist movies are notmeant to be feel-good flicks and this one tried to be just that Every couple of minutes during the second half of the movie I found myself saying no way Without giving the whole story away it revolved around an armored car guard who was financially down and out and whose house was going into foreclosure He was invited in on a heist and accepted only to back down once the action began Weak
At the heart of almost every truly great crime thriller is a carefully considered methodically planned-out high stakes super-crime which 9 times out of 10 is committed by a bunch of likable grey-scale morality underdogs for who life isnt fair for whom getting back at the man is well something worth cheering for First-time screenwriter James V Simpsons script for Armored gets this half right He made extra-double-sure that weve got nothing but sympathy for the recently orphaned Iraq war veteran Ty Hackett (Stomp the Yards Columbus Short) whos about to have his house taken away by an evil bank (brother Ive been there) And he gave Ty a good family friend in Mike (Matt Dillon) who is super nice and gets him a job at the armored car company that he works at with Baines (Lawrence Fishbourne) and some weird French dude (Jean Reno) These guys like to have fun and play pranks but they are also serious armored car guys too so that means they carry guns and are toughbr br After a short while as one theoretically watches Armored one might start to think as I did that maybe - just maybe - this is going to be some kind of awesome tongue-in-cheek cornball heist movie with some on-the-nose characterizations that move the story along its natural course cranking up the personal stakes of all involved in hopes of unveiling a really really clever plan with lots of potential holy sht moments I mean the music alone is textbook heist-movie - gritty edgy beats working overtime as were treated to close-ups of characters who say things like As a matter of fact I do and Are you crazy?? For 45 minutes or so the movie had some serious genre-flick potentialbr br Then things start to really stink These dudes these idiots have no plan Theres no Ok heres what were gonna do scene no blueprints no explosives no black van or ski-masks (despite their test-run as can be seen in a trailer) No these guys are going to steal $42 million dollars from their own trucks (which are only being tracked by HOURLY contact over the radio despite being equipped with some fancy big-deal GPS technology) and they arent even going to sit down and discuss it Hell Mike only tells Ty about the plan the night before which is completely ridiculous But of course Tys got his house to think about so as long as Mike promises that no one will get hurt hes on board Guess what though Somebody gets hurt Why? Because besides driving the trucks into an abandoned factory to hide the money they have no plan That was it That was how far they thought things out So naturally things start to unravel These cats deserve everything they get for being so unpreparedbr br This script frankly feels like its like the product of some bad improv game: Armored Car robbed by its own guardsGO! Despite some half-decent buildup that could have maybe taken the film in a few interesting directions the story just completely falls apart and pretty soon NOTHING makes sense or is even remotely plausiblebr br When filmmakers dont have a cool hook for their heist their characters seem stupid and bungling And when characters are stupid and bungling its hard for an audience to invest in them and their story And when that happens any suspense drains out the bottom of the movie leaving a laughable hollow huskbr br Skip it 310
I had been amazed by director Antals Kontroll back in 2003 His first American project Vacancy was less impressive but a decent start Armored is his second feature and while the visual signature is recognizable the film never rises above the level of a B movie br br Its a shame because the main premise has all the ingredients for twists and turns and the ensemble cast featuring many quality actors should be able to deliver Antal could have made a great heist film but instead goes for an action flick Then again he could have shot a cool action flick but it doesnt really deliver in that department either br br What you are left with is one implausible situation after another a group of poorly sketched characters bicker and fight over a sum of money If you look past the sharp cinematography cast and the tight music score youre left with what could have been a below average direct-to-video featuring Van Damme or Seagal br br This was probably the most disappointing movie for me in quite some time
After reading Fool For Love in a Drama class of mine I was looking forward to seeing how Sam Shepards wonderful play would be translated to the screen Much to my dismay it was nowhere near as entertaining as the play The film seemed to drag the music was inappropriate for the tone of the movie and all the raw energy of the play seemed to have been sucked out of this film version Its a shame to see this come out this way even with Shepards involvement playing the role of Eddie Do yourselves a favorsee the play next time its being performed in your area or simply read the book instead
Fool for Love is one of the several now forgotten films Robert Altman directed throughout the 1980s This one a screen adaptation of a Sam Shepard play that features Shepard in the lead role just simply isnt very good Altman made many not-very-good films over the course of his fascinating career and many times the fault was his But here I think the fault lies with Shepard for writing such a flimsy play Altmans direction is assured the performances are ok given what the actors have to work with but this inconsequential screenplay goes nowhere and takes its time getting therebr br Shepard is Eddie a stuntman who has a lovehate relationship with May (Kim Basinger) The two fight endlessly over the course of an evening spent in some dusty motel in the middle of nowhere while a mysterious man (Harry Dean Stanton) who may be either a figurative or literal father to both Eddie and May quietly observes Randy Quaid rounds out the four-person cast as a gentleman callerbr br The only dramatic hook in the entire plot is the suggestion that Eddies and Mays relationship is incestuous However this hook feels more like a gimmick than anything The screenplay doesnt explore their relationship in any detail and it doesnt use their relationship to explore any more universal themes Shepard and Basigner create eccentric mannered characters who grow irritating within the first five minutes; Stanton and Quaid have little to do but provide reaction shots br br The last half hour or so of the film is especially bad when Eddies and Mays back stories begin to play out in flashback over monotone somnolent voice overbr br Chalk this up to another of Altmans experiments gone awrybr br Grade: C-
I saw this only because my 10-yr-old was bored He and his friend hated it but of course liked being at the movies This is the first time Ive strongly disagreed with Ebert in many years There is not a single thing to recommend this film Willis is good as always But the story stinks is unbelievable there is no real story no action no interesting cinematic sequences no surprises and worst of all the child star is A thoroughly repulsive slug guaranteed to turn off any parent who does not have a dweeby fat slob for a kid By all means stay away and spare your child - unless you want to punish him or her There is no excuse for such lousy directing or writing and one hopes these filmmakers will suffer accordingly
The first few minutes showing the cold and crusty the Willis character were pretty enjoyable especially with Jean Smart but it really tanked after that This is just hackneyed big man and little irritating kid stuff from way back with no innovation at all I know that the casting probably picked this kid to show that Willis was just as irritating in his younger self but I found this kid ESPECIALLY irritating and whinney
There are a few scripts like this one floating around Hollywood; this one is not even close to the best--just the first This is all production value no substance but the Disney name probably will help it A good idea a wasted opportunity
Bruce Willis as usual does an excellent jobbr br [warning: may be considered a spoiler]br br While my friend thought it was good I kept glancing at my watch during the entire movie wondering when it would end After seeing such great flicks as The Patriot and Chicken Run I was really disappointed in Disneys The Kidbr br Willis plays a middle-aged man with a harsh and realistic attitude on putting a positive spin on peoples images (hes an Image Consultant) An unknown kid shows up Yes its him but younger and even Lily Tomlin can see him At this point Im reminded of a cross between a poor Quantum Leap episode and a bad time traveling flickbr br Kid and Willis go through trying to figure out why hes in that time period They figure it out They meet Willis when hes older Nevermind that it never goes into detail how old Willis teleports them between time periods and gets them together to begin with how he got that knowledge to begin with how he came to the realization that he needed to do this and so onbr br Basically its a very tired unoriginal uninspiring plot that has some great actors in it The good news is that the Kid actor is nowhere near as annoying as hes presented in the trailers on television
After 15 minutes watching the movie I was asking myself what to do: leave the theater sleep or try to keep watching the movie to see if there was anything worth I finally watched the movie: what a waste of time Maybe I am not a 5 years old kid anymore!
I cant emphasize it enough do NOT get this movie for the kidsbr br For that matter youd best spare the adults from it as wellbr br All right perhaps Im overexaggerating a little This isnt the worst kids movie no let me rephrase that This isnt the worst movie made by dissilusioned adults FOR dissilusioned adults and somehow marketed towards kids (that would be Jack which Ive been meaning to review  gut like a fish)br br Adults wont learn anything surprising (well if you must fast-forward to just before the end credits for a Educational Bit about an Interesting Cosmic Phenominon) We dont usually end up doing as adults what we wanted to do as kids as reality tends to get in the way Well duh I could have told you that (so can four years of college at an art school but I degress)br br I have no idea what the heck kids could possibly get out of this movie Most likely it will only upset them (we get to watch the moment when Russ was traumatized at eight years old) Theres a better movie Kikis Delivery Service that has essentially the same message but handles it litely instead of drilling it into your head And the adults will like it too!br br By the way there is a moment in the movie made with amature MST3K-ers in mind if they think of that OTHER Bruce Willis movie with a sad little kid in it
what was Bruce Willis thinking when he signed on for this one?? this one made no sense to me i was so confused by it it wasnt funny at all I dont even know why Disney made this one Bruce is a Great actor whom ive liked for a Long time  and this disappointed me a lot Pass this one by on the video shelf
The Kid was born retarded It pulls in a half-dozen directions features dialog and action lifted from much older and better-known flops and might be funny -- if only the writers knew what funny isbr br Disney stuff has gotten a lot better in the last couple of decades but dont let that fool you They should have given The Kid a wide berth sang it a lullaby then ran the train into a ravine Mercy killing
First of all I wasnt sure who this film was aimed at - it seemed like a story for kids but had stuff in it kids wouldnt understand and find boring There wasnt really much to it Bruce Willis wasnt stretched as an actor at all He did a lot of glancing to the side with that half smile of his - unless you are a big fan of his I wouldnt bother And if its the story youre interested in (guy who seems to have it all but is lacking emotionally is taught lessons from a child) I would go to see About A Boy It has everything this film lacked humor sadness and reality
Like a lot of movies involving little kids this starts off real cute and likableand then after about a half hour or so becomes the reversebr br Thats certainly the case here in this time-travel story (which I usually love) where an adult meets a kid who his really him at the age of eight! Great premise and a great lead actor in Bruce Willis butbr br The kid Rusty is a smart-aleck and whiny brat and Willis Rusty grown up now as Russell gets abrasive with his constant yelling That is entertainment? No thanksbr br Young Breslin has gone on to become a very good child actor being involved in a number of films including The Cat In The Hat opposite a more famous child actor: Dakota Fanning br br Overall a disappointing film especially with all the good press this movie got when it was released
The Robot vs the Aztec Mummy was one of the silliest and least believable films Ive ever seen OK I can buy that the woman in the film is a reincarnation of a virgin that was sacrificed to an Aztec God What I cant buy is that the incredibly phony looking mummy and the even worse looking robot When you want to watch a film like this you want to see lots of fighting action But the robot and the mummy fight for about a minute total! Probably worst of all was the dia de los muertos art they had in the credits Its the worst Ive ever seen Avoid this one if possible
Awful confusing bit of crap from South of the Border Ive now watched it twice and I STILL dont really know what was going on It had something to do with a stupid looking Aztec mummy a human robot thats the dumbest looking robot Ive ever seen bar none and a woman who is the reincarnation of some ancient Aztec chick Most of the story is told in a painfully slow and droning manner by an incredibly dull scientist This guy is a marvelous sleep aid His nemesis is a fat slob called The Bat which is a pretty unimaginative name for an evil scientistbr br I guess the boring scientist and his wormy assistant dug up the mummy and what a shocker the scientists wife just HAPPENS to be the reincarnation of the mummys girlfriend They keep the mummy perpetually in a mausoleum for some reason I guess so that the overacting bad guy can steal it It takes him five years to do this because hes inventing a human robot to steal the mummy or attack it or whatever Hes after some treasure that the mummy has so that he can be rich But excuse me if the guy had this huge an intellect and a strong drive to succeed why didnt he just patent some of his ideas and get rich that way? br br Oh well I suppose that would make too much sense Instead there is ridiculous fight between the mummy and the robot and its really hard to tell which one is faker looking or more cheesy To tell you the truth I watched this because I thought a film with a name like The Robot Vs the Aztec Mummy just HAD to be fabulously cheesy Instead it was just dully awful and mind blowingly confusing
Oh man they sure knew how to make them back then Hollywood has forgotten the basic ingredients of bad movie making: cardboard steel and the god fearing scientist action hero! br br This film was so close to a masterpiece alas it was not to be as it failed to feature ray guns and invaders from the Moon The MST3K version tried to fix this by adding a pilot of a show called Captain Cody where a guy with a rocket propelled jacket fights bad make-up people from the Moon but it didnt quite add upbr br Also the comments of the guys in the theater were not nearly as funny as I expected them to be All in all a great disappointment
There must be an error This movie belongs with Plan 9 and a lot others as a quite entertaining silly diversion Youll never accept you like it yet you will watch it whenever it comes out on TV Its as simple as that
Mexican classic was the third entry in the Aztec Mummy series As you will soon find out this movie is anything but a classic instead its more like a movie that deliberately tries to bore youbr br Some scientist wants to steal Aztec treasure from a tomb but guarding that tomb is that walking toilet paper commercial: The Aztec Mummy Knowing he cant beat the Mummy he then builds a robot and a very bad one at that We only get to see MrRobot in the last reel as he clunks around and does battle with the Aztec Mummybr br I have seen a lot of lousy Sci-Fi films hell most Sci-Fi films I see are lousy but this one for its entire duration of 64 Minuites is the worst movie Ive seen with Fubar coming in a close secondbr br In conclusion: Dont waste your time
With the dialogue in the dubbed version of this film I dont think that Shakespeare is in any great danger This is the story of an ancient Aztec mummy who has been disenfranchised His stuff has been taken and this really ticks him off He seems to know whos doing this even though hes a gyrating raving entity I loved the two dull men who tell the story of how the mummy was found and the doctor who is determined to destroy the creature There are all these scenes in this ridiculous graveyard full of cheap crosses and other junk Theres a mausoleum where the mummy is kept I cant begin to reproduce the idiocy of this including a snake pit where the good doctor is thrown (there is a door next to it so he can crawl out) to the robot a mass of metal cans with a guy inside The dialogue is awful There are long pauses between speeches as if someone offstage is feeding them their lines I love the scene where the two little kids accuse their mother of going out at night (she goes into this zombie state or something) Nonetheless if your looking for a film that you can laugh at and never takes itself seriously watch this Have a couple beers first Like a direct line from the mummys tomb Watch this and your eyes will bleed and your breath will stink What more can I say?
SPOILERS The third and mercifully last of the Aztec Mummy trilogy in the fact that the series major star-besides the Mummy- actor Ramon Gay as Dr Eduardo Almada was gunned down by the outraged husband of a woman he was having an affair with on May 28 1960! Still that didnt stop Gay in him being edited into them from his previous films from being in a number of future Mexican horror movies made over the next four years after his deathbr br In Robot vs the Aztec Mummy we have the once again mad scientist Dr Krupp trying to get his hands on the Mummys golden breastplate and bracelet in order by having them deciphered to find the Aztez treasure thats been secretly buried somewhere in modern Mexico City over 500 years ago Robot vs the Aztec Mummy is not much as a movie in itself in that its made up of stock footage of the previous Aztec Mummy films that take up over half of the films running timebr br After getting introduced to the movies cast members some who have been killed in the previous Aztec Mummy films we get down to the real nitty gritty in it involving the evil as well as criminally insane Dr Krupp also know as The Bat Dr Krupp-who looks like a wild eyed and crazed Orson Wells-is a man with boundless visions of grandeur in him not only uncovering the long lost Aztec treasure but now unlike in the two previous movies he was in creating life and using it in making an army of human robots to take over the world An idea he must have gotten from watching Ed Woods 1955 Atomic Superman classic Bride of the Monsterbr br Unable to handle the Mummy in his two other encounters with it where he ended up getting thrown by it into a snake pit filled with deadly rattlers Dr Krupp had created a robot with a human cadaver stuffed in it to the job of doing in the Mummy for him With he Mummy sleeping in its tomb at a local Mexico City cemetery Dr Krupp has his Robot-Man brake into the Mummys crypt to do battle with it and destroy it with its bolts of deadly radiation br br SPOILERS The big built-up to the Aztec Mummy Robot-Man confrontation turns to be a big let-down with the Mummy having no trouble at all dispatching the Tin-Man in less then 30 seconds together with its creator Dr Krupp All this while both Dr Almada and his friend and assistant Pinacate who came to the Mummys aid have nothing at all to do but sit back and watch the action Now without the mad and off-the-wall Dr Krupp annoying it the Mummy can go back to its eternal resting place without ever worrying about the problems of the modern world at large like Dr Krupp that it has really no interest in
Following the pleasingly atmospheric original and the amusingly silly second one this incredibly dull slow and uneventful sequel comes across as a major letdown Once again the nefarious criminal mastermind the Bat (hammy Luis Aceves Castaneda) is trying to steal valuable jewelry from the Aztec mummy Popoca The Bat builds a hilariously clunky lumbering robot with a human brain in order to achieve this heinous goal Flatly directed by Rafael Portillo with a talky and tedious script by Alfredo Salazar and Guillermo Calderon cruddy continuity (for example the Bat was clearly killed at the end of the previous film but is miraculously alive and well here!) an excruciatingly sluggish script an excessive amount of stock footage from the first two flicks a meandering narrative a crippling lack of action and momentum largely dreary going through the motions (non)acting from an understandably disinterested cast and a poorly staged climactic battle between the mummy and the robot (the movie finally bursts to sidesplitting stupid life with said big bash but alas it barely even lasts two lousy minutes and thus proves to be much too little far too late to alleviate the severity of the general overwhelming boredom) this numbingly dry drippy and draggy snorefest rates as a complete washout
The first 23 of this film wasnt that dissimilar to the American mummy films of the 30s and 40s Two lovers in ancient Mexico dared to defy the law and were doomed to die One became an Aztec mummy whose job it was to guard the sacred treasure and his lady love And the lady was reincarnated in the present day and the mummy was naturally attracted to her So far its all the typical mummy filmthough its quite a bit slower and duller than the American versions Oh and of course the Aztec mummy looked really really crappybr br However into this standard but boring film there is a super-villain Why? I dunno--it sure didnt make any sense to have one It seems this villain wants the treasure and he manages to hypnotize the lady and have her show them where the Aztec treasure is buried Why does he need the treasure? Well to buy the equipment needed to make an army of atomic robots dummy! But first he has to construct a single mummy to defeat the mummy as the mummy has so far been unstoppablebr br Youve got to see these human-robots as they look like the enormous clunky robots from Flash Gordon and other serials BUT they have a rubber head of a supposed dead guy inside! They really look hilariously funny and seeing the conclusion when there is a huge battle between the lethargic mummy and the equally slow robot is worth sitting through the rest of the dull movie Both battle in super-slow-motion like they are bathed in taffy and its done in such an artless and silly fashion that it is bound to elicit chuckles--certainly not thrillsbr br Overall the film is dreadfully dull and a muddled mess--especially at the end However for bad movie fans its a must-see--its bad but unintentionally funny and great to watch and laugh at with friends
23 of this movie is recycled footage of the previous movies a fact thats sadly obvious even to someone like myself who hasnt seen the original movies And somehow it feels like a rip-off even though I havent seen the stuff before Its like that episode of every TV show where the characters sit around a photo album or something and you just see recycled footage of other episodes Ive seen some producers do extended montages of recycled footage but never anything beyond 5 minutes or so This movie is mostly stuff that had already been seen by audiences so you could mount a case that its one of the biggest rip-offs ever foisted on the motion picture publicbr br I got to see it in the theater in a 16mm print which is good enough I suppose considering how rare this kind of material must be on film these days I give the movie some credit for semi-convincing Gothic atmosphere and for unintentional humor but thats about it The Aztec mummy monster looks good even has some mobility in his face which is better than most movie monsters of the period But the robot is pitiful although its interesting that they made the human face totally visible Its a robot human or something of the sort as they somewhat explain in the movie I think thats considered an android So technically in hard sci-fi terms this movie should be called Android vs the Aztec Mummy but I doubt anyone was too worried about technicalities here anymore than they were worried about quality In fact the movie is so sloppily put together that it makes television look good Even the dubbing from Mexican into English is lazy and weak -- for example at one point the hero says I might as well begin at the beginning what the heck kind of translation is that? Couldnt they at least have him say start at the beginning so that it doesnt sound repetitive? A high school newspaper editor could have fixed the screenplay of this movie Its the epitome of utilitarian film-making just absolutely nothing is in this movie that doesnt need to be there for the basic commercial purpose of the film They put no more effort into making it than they had to and considering the extensive recycled footage I would doubt that they actually spent more than a week making this moviebr br I will now cease posting about it on the principle that I dont want to expend more energy in the process of commenting than the creators of the movie actually expended while making it
Ah such an original title for a very shoddy film The dubbing is hilarious since the voices and mouths never seem to match As a result I had no idea what was going on as I watched this mess unfold There are flashbacks within the flashbacks and no real time takes place until towards the very end The Aztec ceremony had me laughing I rewinded it twice and got the best ab workout ever The singing Aztec lady is comic naturale and the dancing and costumes are a hoot Some guy gets a face full of acid theres a lot of fighting you have no idea who any character is (not that I really cared) and its a whole noir mess Oh and the actual fight doesnt happen for awhile so during the movie feel free to get up take a nap take a trip You wont miss anything exciting
I saw this on Mystery Science Theater 3000 and even that show couldnt really make this movie bearable I could make a better movie with a broken camcorder and action figures Of course you expect terrible special effects with a movie this old but Ive seen silents that were better The storyline has enormous gaps that leave you trying to figure out why they are even at certain scenes The cameraman apparently doesnt know what a tripod is and had too much coffee or something harder maybe because the camera is ALWAYS shaking around I couldnt even follow the plot but suffice it to say this is the absolute worst movie I have ever seen in my lifebr br UPDATE: I saw Epic Movie a while back and have decided to give this movie a 2 Its NOT the worst movie Ive ever seen anymore!
I am a big fan of bad horrors cheap horrors b movies and all that bottom 100 movies and I do not deny those are the worst stuff ever to enter the big screen or even your home video for that matter Some of them eg the infamous Manos The Hands of Fate are truly bad and watching them especially on your own without any friends and beer around is a torture for a good cinema taste br br La Momia Azteca Contra El Roboto Humano however was not that bad Well of course its BAD - its silly dated corny cheap etc theres an Aztec mummy a tin robot a fat masked villain a mad scientist Mexican mobsters etc the montage is poor the lines well lets say the lines are not theatrical the FX and SFX are the best what the Mexican low budget production couldve offered etc etc Still the movie is FUN its so bad it makes you laugh cheerfully for an hour time Sure it depends on ones sense of humor however Im pretty sure La Momia should teach any newcomers to this kind of cinema how to enjoy it Please note: the movie lasts for about an hour and I think its just enough time of silliness one is able to easily digest br br Theres also another thing - watching La Momia can give you a clue what was the whole SFHorror genre concept back in the fifties when you compare it to the present day Matrix era of cinema entertainment I think it also shows how both the industry and the audience evolved due to the fact the watches like La Momia still attract full house in the theaters for some special shows (movies like this are special alright) and very often receive a standing ovation
Despite having a very pretty leading lady (Rosita Arenas one of my boy-crushes) the acting and the direction are examples of what NOT to do while making a moviebr br Placed in southern Mexico Popoca the Aztec Mummy (real Aztecs by the way DID not made mummies) has been waken up by the lead characters and starts making trouble in Mexico City suburbia during the first movie (The Aztec Mummy) In this second part the leading man and woman want to find th mummy and put it in its final resting place (a fireplace would have been my first choice)br br Into this appears The Bat a criminal master-mindless stereotype of a criminal genius who creates a human robot (some idiot inside a robot SUIT) to control Popoca and (get this) take over the world The final match between the robot and the mummy is hilarious some of the worst choreography ever witnessed The funniest part is that this movie was made and released by a serious Mexican movie studio!br br The acting is just as awful hearing the movie in Spanish as it is in English (they dubbed the over-acting!) You should watch this movie through MST:3000 The comments are even funnier
This movie should have been billed as three movie-summaries linked together to form a full-length feature film (including lots of shots of people slowly walking down dark corridors and streets) BE WARNED! The first hour of this movie is simply a re-hash of the first two Aztec movies as told by the main character The actual movie doesnt start until the thing is almost over I must say the overacting on the part of the Bat is quite hilariousbr br As for the robot I thought a robot was a mechanical device that may or may not resemble a human The Bats robot consists of a radioactive reanimated corpse encased in a lead robot-body As Tom Servo put it Hes not that impressive; he doesnt even have knees! That and it takes the robot about an hour just to lumber across the room But once he catches you WATCH OUT! Hell disintegrate you with a touch (powered by radium? Pluh-ease!)br br This is a great movie when accompanied by Joel and the Bots Otherwise youre just a glutton for abuse
RVAMs reputation preceded it I first heard of it in one of those Medved style movie books The 50 Worst Movies Ever or The Golden Turkey Awards or something like that Every review of the film basically said that this movie was so bad that it would make you bleed from the eyes to watch it So when the Exposed Film Society finally got around to showing it I was anticipating the kind of cathartic experience that only a true cinematic stinker can provide br br However Robot wasnt really all that bad br br Oh this is definitely a Z film through and through Some of the voice dubbing (as is usually the case for K Gordon Murray imports) is awfully cheesy and the movie itself seems to be structurally something of a Frankenstein since a huge chunk of it seems to be footage from a previous Aztec Mummy movie narrated with a voice-over by the leading man A dead giveaway: anytime the question Then what happened? is asked more than twice in the dialog you are looking at reassembled footage put together with little regard for plot coherence or momentum In RVAM Then what happened? or What happened then? is uttered at least four times in the 1st hour br br Even without the structural problems the plot and dialog dont translate well to an older American audience For instance as the hero explains (and explains and explains) the back-story he includes a remark about Doctor Krupp a doctor who suddenly turned into an evil master criminal and began his quest for the treasure that the Aztec mummy guards No background no explanation he just suddenly turned evil Obviously this was aimed at a pretty undiscriminating audience br br The clincher though is the Robot the supposed showcase of this movie This Robot is the worst robot special effect since Undersea Kingdom or even Santa Claus Vs The Martians Compared to this hunk of junk the Tin Man from the Wizard Of Oz looked like the Terminator chassis that chased Linda Connor through the foundry in T2 The Aztec Mummy himself is well designed and executed; hes recognizably undead familiar enough to look like a mummy and yet distinct from the Boris Karloff bandage collection familiar to most American audiences But whoever designed the Robot in this followup had no feel for the conceptor no budget They could at least have given him some knees for heavens sake br br In addition the titular battle is terribly executed and lasts less than 60 seconds (Ive seen shoving matches on junior high playgrounds that are more convincing) Then the movie basically just stops That seems a bit of a rip off considering the amount of time the movie spends building up to the battle itselfbr br In spite of all these problems the movie isnt horrible or incompetent the way a Coleman Francis film or a Larry Buchanan film was Compared to Monster A-Go-Go or Attack of The Eye Creatures RVTAM is like a Coppola film Its just kind of dull and boring and silly The actors are competent (in a mannered B movie way) and reasonably photogenic; Dr Krupp in particular seems to be having a wonderful time as he leers and plots and capers about in his cape and Phantom Of the Opera suit I often found myself rooting for him in spite of his being the villain br br Anyway Ive seen much much worse File this with Samson Vs The Vampire Women under interesting Mexican juvenile oddities
I have watched this movie twice in the past six months (what I go through so you dont have to)The first viewing left me half crazed and babblingThe second viewing at 5am on a rainy morn was a little betterI only screamed in agony oncebr br  Seems Pocona (The Aztec Mummy)had the hots for a certain Aztec Princess who wassupposed to keep her maidenObviously they gave each other the business and were put to death for it(Now that is severe!)But before they are the film tries to put us to death with a screeching Aztec ceremonyThe singing will make your ears bleedbr br  Anyhow there is the usual reincarnation nonsense Not to mention a treasure map on a breastplate & bracelet guarded by that swathed slobPoconaBy this time Pocona looks like hes been on a 2000 year bender and is after the defilers of his tombHis groans & moans sounds like he has a bad case of Montezumas revenge(or he read the script for this movie)That will make your breath stinkbr br  An evil Dr Von Krupp appears wanting the Aztec treasure(possibly to finance acting lessons & screenwriting classes for cast & crew)He is called The Bat because in The Curse Of The Aztec Mummy he wore a bat like cape hat and something like a ski mask over his faceGuess its better than the Laughing Fat Manbr br  The Bat in typical mad scientist fashion wants to rule the world He stresses this by rolling his eyeslaughing maniacally and chewing the sceneryHe has cobbled together an invincible robotLooks like the bot was made from a garbage can a chandelier and the grill of a 1957 BuickThis will make your eyes bleedA company even takes credit for making this tin can!br br  Well the mighty showdown between Pocona and the Robot takes place in the Mummys new crypt having been made homeless earlierbr br  About half of this movie is culled from La Aztec Momianever released in the US in its original form but in a chopped atrocity from Jerry Warren(see my review on Attack Of The Mayan Mummy) and Curse Of The Aztec MummyThe robot is frankly stupid as are most of the charactersIf that and the plot doesnt make you howl with laughter nothing willbr br  My first impression was so bad it would have gotten a one But after seeing Mayan Mummy(which is a movie deserving of being burned) and watching Robot again it garners a 3You have to watch this with no expectations at all Then it can be naively pleasant
the usual disclaimer - I do not give 1 star ratings to movies which are harmless bad low budget and silly although they may deserve it These films are often funny and get rated 2-4 based sheerly on entertainment value - not as a representation of their exemplary film artistry This film fits this model perfectly It is a Mexican monster movie riddled with voice-over narrative and extremely weak not-so-special effects The makeup is not that bad and the acting is sometimes quite entertaining but this film is almost as silly as Aliens vs Predator and the script isnt half as slick (Aliens vs Predator might get a 1 from me but I want to see it again before I commit)br br The plot is ridiculous but deliciously convoluted If youve read this far you must really want to know A group of remarkably unscientific scientists comprise the main characters Most of them are heroes - sort of - but one is (of course) mad and quite perverse This mad scientist invents a laughable nuclear powered robot (who looks a bit like the tin man from Wizard of Oz but has a human face inexplicably located inside its head) An Aztec mummy discovered by the same scientist whose wife just so happens to have been an Aztec princess in a past life (dont ask) is pitted against the robot for the big climax the fight scene alone is enough to put the most stoic movie watcher on the floor in belly laughsbr br For what its worth given the budget and the utter silliness of the script this is a very entertaining low budget goof ball monster movie If youre into that sort of thing go for it
Im in two minds about FOLLOWING  the film debut of Christopher Nolan  Part of me admires it for costing 6000 dollars to make but part of me hates it for being too art house  In many ways it reminds me of the cult movie PI  a film I disliked  and I cant get my head around the central plot of a man who wants to be writer following people around  Wouldnt it be more logical for someone wanting to be a writer to sit in front of a keyboard and write ? br br Oh well I guess FOLLOWING gives indie film makers hope that just because they made a no budget movie costing $6000 over two thousand IMDB members will vote for it and over five hundred members will comment on it  but you have to wonder if this movie would be so well regarded if it wasnt made by the director of MEMENTO ?
On Humphrey Bogarts first trip to Hollywood he got his first leading man role in this B picture Love Affair The first thing you ought to realize is that this film has absolutely nothing to do with the classic Love Affair later in the decade with Charles Boyer and Irene Dunne or the two remakes that followed Its not half as good any of those filmsbr br In fact Bogey is second billed to Dorothy Mackaill as a spoiled heiress who finds out shes been living her extravagant lifestyle courtesy of her late fathers best friend and financial adviser Hale Hamilton It comes as quite a shock to Mackaill She considers a show business career as a way for an incomebr br Bogart is a test pilot who is also an aeronautical engineer and hes designing an ultimate airplane motor and is looking for investors Mackaill is willing to do it besides she likes what she sees in Bogeybr br Considering the cynical roles that Bogart later made a specialty its a bit disconcerting to see him as this highly moral and self righteous character in Love Affair The part doesnt wear well on himbr br Love Affair is your average B program second feature nothing terribly special about it
In 1932 Humphrey Bogart was a relative unknown--an unproven actor who was starring in one of his first films And because he was an unknown the movie they gave him was clearly a B-movie--a quick film with relatively low expectations After seeing it I could see why it would still take Bogart many more years AND another film studio before he became a household name While the film isnt terrible it certainly isnt good--making it more of a curiosity than anything else when seen todaybr br Bogart is a pilot who has dreams of building his own aircraft engine company However when a vacuous rich playgirl comes his way his dreams all seem to go on hold As one of the characters in the film said the combination of the two is like oil and water--they just dont mixbr br While Bogart is throwing away his promising career his sister is going full speed on the Road to Skankville--having met a sleazy guy who convinces her to sleep with rich guys so they can shake them down for tons of cash! Bogey has no idea his sister ISNT the actress she claims to be and doesnt realize later that the rich woman he loves leaves him for the same guy whose mistress isBogarts SISTER!!! All this leads up to a finale that is reasonably enjoyable However what follows is one of the dumbest scenes I have watched in a very long time! By now the rich lady is not going to marry the guy sleeping with Bogeys sister (whew!) but because shes now poor and no good for Bogart shes about to fly away and kill herself Bogey finds out chases the plane on foot jumps on the plane as its taking off and crawls up the fuselage to take control of the plane and save her!!! This is so utterly silly and ridiculous I found myself laughing out loud Up until then I might have scored it a 4 or 5--this sunk the movie to a 3 (how one reviewer gave this an 8 is beyond me)br br The bottom line is that this was a talking and silly film On top of that its all wrong for Bogart as the action hero at the end and the simpering lover are horrible matches for his persona that was so wonderfully created in the early 40s Manly and solid better suits the man--one of Americas great actors but clearly out of his element herebr br By the way those who love Pre-Code films and their very adult sensibilities may want to see this one Practically everyone in the film believes in and practices pre-marital sex and Bogey curses in the film--things you never would have seen after the toughened and more moralistic Production Code was adopted in 1934
This is so embarrassing Its a REMAKE of The Wedding Singer which happens to be my favorite movie which gives me another reason to disapprove of this film It has the same plot same jokes same characters Jeez people need to be more original
Where should I begin with this movie All I know is that it is a mess Be the script story or the actors First of all this movie is very disappointing from Salman Khan who gave us a fun Dulhan Hum Le Jayenge and Har Dil Jo Pyar Karega before this Second Rani is getting really annoying appearing in every stupid movie since Kuch Kuch Hota Hai (glad Saathiya stopped this nonsense) The story is stolen from The Wedding Singer but ruins the funny movie The dialogues are lacking I may have laughed here and there but entertained? NO!!! Salman Khan was tolerable in the above mentioned movies but here he is insane His character is poorly written One minute he is poor and next minute you wonder how is he poor Rani Mukherjee looks like a plain jain and wasnt putting any effort She luckily redeemed her career with Saathiya because her career was going haywire around this time Pooja Batra put a little charm here with her looks but it is still not enough Jackie Shroff is wasted Kashmira Shahs beauty and acting has ran away from her because she chose such a horrible script Raveena Tandon looks beautiful but puts little performance Mohnish Behl gets the award for Worst (Supporting) Actor (they need Razzies because there have been terrible movies in India) He says stupid dialogues dances terribly looks weird and is not in his regular form Just to tell you there is more to the cast who are also terrible If it werent for Raveenas awesome beauty in Aa Meri Life Bana De I wouldnt give the movie a point Otherwise the dancing by Salman was terrible Pooja Batra was dancing like a wind in Savariya otherwise I wish the costumes were given a make-over and the rest of the cast (and their monkey dancing) had been blown away from the wind The good song of the album was O Priya O Priya which doesnt have a good enough picturization Same goes for the half way decent title song Otherwise this movie (and the rest of the songs) are a no-no for everyone
K Murli Mohan Rao made the much better BANDHAN in 1998 This film is an awful remake of THE WEDDING SINGERbr br Basically in short the film consists of: Salman Khan who in those days used to have the role of a dejected lover who looses his girl and also he had his comic scenes where he hammed badly even today he does well he does it all here too and also looses his shirt in scenesbr br Jackie Shroff- wasted bored and tired his role is so stupid He is shown as a lover of Pooja Bhatra then in 1 scene he is shown as a womanizer?br br Inder Kumar- confusing characterization againbr br Rani Mukherjee- boring overweight and does nothing special Pooja Bhatra- tall fair and actress worthy but lacks talentbr br Kashmira Shah- says a dial as if a poetrybr br Mohinish Behl- poor fellow the 2 kids were awful toobr br The story is the same and has awful comic scenes a sudden love story and boring drunken scenes plus a forced comic track of Shakti Kapoorbr br Direction is poor Music is decentbr br Salman khan just goes through the motions Jackie is bad Rani is as usual Pooja is bad Mohinish and Kashmira are nothing great Inder is awful
When I read the reviews of Kahin Pyaar Na Ho Jaaye I thought Huh? It was THAT confusing To be sure I went to watch the film and what do you know? Its a remake of The Wedding Singer Several scenes have been changed to suit the whole essence of Indianness but the rest of it is a direct lift from the 1998 Hollywood hit Bollywood is no stranger to remakes but this is one so poor that it pains me just to watch it I groaned so much watching this and I realized I wasnt the only one doing so! One guy actually walked out of the theater and never came back! Salman Khan should seriously stop doing comedy roles He shrieks and whines too much Why cant he just take it easy? He doesnt do justice to the role originally acted out by Adam Sandler He doesnt have Sandlers sense of comic timing Rani is a wonderful actress and one of my favorites but shes no Drew Barrymore either The scene where she stands in front of a mirror practicing to say her new surname (Hi Im Mrs Pugalia) doesnt match up to Barrymores version (Hi Im Mrs Julia Gulia) I felt embarrassed watching that scene even though I had loved the original The music is not too bad Its probably the only saving grace of this otherwise horrible film! Avoid this at all cost!
There are no - NO redeeming qualities to this film They didnt check a single fact - NOT ONE about anything I feel sorry for Larry Miller and even more sorry for his agent for not being more capable for finding him a more suitable venuebr br The adults are all idiotic The effects are cheesy and devoid of any sense of reality The music is honestly cheesy The plot is beyond beliefbr br I you want to see something good with your family see anything else Take some time and check for mildew in your attic My ten-year-old is mocking this film as we watch it Hes unfortunately learning that not every movie is worth watching
This is officially the terrible boring corny and ridiculous movie ever created The movie is all about a crazy kid and his friends and they land a 747 His dreams are very corny and make no sense at all and is very poorly done Every special effect looks as if it was done without any modern technology and might have been created by the kid that plays the leading role in the movie If you watch this movie it will definitely make you stupider I advise you to never consider watching this movie and if you do good luck and dont miss the brain cells you killed off My comment does not even fully grasp the awful creation from hell that has been made The person that wrote the comment before me did not watch the same movie that I dreadfully watched and wish I never watched Peace
Oh how the critics fell all over themselves to praise their goldenboy Paul Schrader (author of Taxi Driver) when this movie came out I never saw the qualities they were detecting when I watched this movie back in the day so I re-viewed it to see if I got it wrong Mishima is extremely uninteresting This is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture The flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy And the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etcbr br It must be a triumph when you learn youve landed Philip Glass; but then you have to get something out of him Glasses score offers not a whit of distinction from his other work nor does it provide the film any perceptible value In 2010 it should be clear to anyone that Schrader squandered his career on work of no impact or importance (Cat People AutoFocus Light Sleeper Patty Hearst American Gigolo) He can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else Schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films
Oceans Twelve: just plain stupid bad and nothing compared to the other twobr br An art robbery 10 known actors at least A weak script and very slow developing idea Thats why I characterize a movie I only saw at least 20 minutes of it Dont get me wrong you may like it But I only like the Oceans films because of the Heist theme If Oceans 12 its not about Heist then whats the point to see it? Glad Soderberg saw his main error and redeemed himself by making a film far superior to the first one Kudos for thatbr br Steven Soderberg isnt really a good director Apart from his hit Sex lies and videotapes nothing else happened so much great to the career of this director Shame on him But his fault only
I enjoyed Oceans 11 I thought it was quite enjoyable helped by the performances and the direction However I was disappointed with this film Dont get me wrong it is not a complete dud thanks to the stellar performances from Brad Pitt Catherine Zeta-Jones George Clooney and Matt Damon especially and the efficient direction from Steven Soderbergh However the film really does suffer from truly lethargic pacing some of the film was so slow I almost fell asleep between one key twist Second the plot is very convoluted and there are many twists and turns that makes it hard to keep up The camera work wasnt as innovative as it was in the first movie either Whereas in the first movie it was smooth and professional it was jerky and awkward here and the music wasnt particularly memorable The screenplay also wasnt as witty or as fun and the film felt anti-climatic At the end of the day it all felt a bit too lazy despite the expert playing and direction So much potential but really a missed opportunity 410 Bethany Cox
What can I say about Oceans Twelve? Who thought that it would ever come to this? A gigantic mess that loses itself halfway and cant retrace I found myself amazed at how bad this really was Really! I have never seen the ending properly because this film is just insufferable Im a huge fan of the first but this is a lame excuse for a sequel br br What was the point of the heist if they were going to give the money back? The movie is just boring and so drag along that I cant ever sit through this It really is bad Just stay as far repeat far away as possible from this movie Its worthless
Watching this movie brings several words to mind: sophomoric ridiculous improbable self-indulgent and finally (and fatally) boring Badly directed badly photographed and badly acted the film is a confusing mess with plot lines (if one can call them that) veering in all directions Someone may have used a five-year olds finger painting as a template As punishment for this childish crime of a movie this cast of stars should be spanked soundly and sent to their respective beds without dinner  All in all it seems like George needed an excuse to get together with his little buddies for a paid summer vacation and were the suckers paying for it Bad George! Bad!
Comparing Oceans Twelve to the 2001 Oceans Eleven did anyone else notice all the things that stayed the same?br br - All the stars returned for Twelve and Zeta-Jones was added;br br - Twelve had the same director;br br - Twelve had the same producers;br br - Twelve had the same production designer;br br - Twelve had the same music director;br br - Twelve had the same film editorbr br Did anyone notice the things than changed once the Oceans franchise was established?br br - Twelves budget was $25 million (30%) greater;br br - Eleven got great reviews but Twelve largely got panned;br br - Eleven made $450 million but Twelve dropped to $362 million;br br - Domestic box office for Twelve dropped 32%;br br - Soderbergh teamed with a different screenwriterbr br Movies are a directors medium of course I almost forgot
I didnt expect a lot when i went out to see this but my god what a disappointment The original was kind of fun within its genre but this is so bad i felt abused when i left the theater Theres no plot its not funny its not enjoyable to watch its straight out embarrassing After an hour i hoped my patience would be rewarded but now i regret not leaving the theater Do yourself a favor and ignore this one see it when it comes to the small screen Or see it on budget DVD whatever you do dont waste any money on it Dont say i didnt warn you
The people who bash this movie were looking for it to be as cool and slick as the first one which this isnt This movie was supposed to be the complete opposite as Oceans 11 This has been said by a lot of the cast members and also the director Steven Soderbergh Oceans 12 while it did lack a gripping plot is being bashed because it was different then what people wanted If it were released before Oceans 11 it would be taken much differently not as a failed sequel The problem with sequels is people go into it with a preset idea of what it should be like it and have lots of expectations They should go into this movie with an open mind and not expect it to be Oceans 11 again
Just like most people I couldnt wait to see this Oceans 11 sequel but it really stinks I must say It stinks because theres simply no good screenplayit was just cheap I hope the producers donate all the money this movie has made (or will make) to the tsunami-victims in Asia so this movie will have at least one good reason to exist It is so bad I even cant write a decent comment about it buti still advise the creators of this thing to make Oceans 13 Oceans 13 will be about the same thieves who are trying to steal a screenplay well hidden somewhere in Hollywood The 13th member will be a foreign (maybeRussian) screenplay-writer who knows all tricks to write a copy of this well hidden screenplay so they can replace the original theyll have to steal Or they need to find at least 13 people to write a decent screenplay for a movie in which not only Julia Roberts plays herself but even all other star-members of the Oceans-films 13 People because its the lucky number of Andy Garcias character
Ive seen professional reviews claiming Julia Roberts playing herself was clever and very funny I think NOT An actress playing herself? And doing it with her same usual dizziness whenever she tries comedy? Talk about Hollyweird narcissism at its utmost Why doesnt she just stand there and go Me me me Look at me! The director and writer should be shot for not thinking of something better then this in what could have been a charming sequel and by the way Steven when the audience starts paying more attention to the weird camera angles then the story you have a problem Capra Hitchcock all used some creative cameras but they were talented enough not to lose the audience in them or just show off with the camera You seem to have forgotten a cardinal rule of film-making in the name of style The Pitt and Zeta Jones chemistry is quite good however perhaps if they had made the film more focused around them and dispensed with the narcissism it might have worked Once again Zeta Jones shows how shes got more talent and beauty then Roberts could dream of Sadly this film wastes talent and fails on many accounts I want my money back
I hadnt planned on watching O12 because I didnt like O11 that much I thought O11 was a nice but slightly boring little bank robbers movie with a sensational arsenal of stars Anyway I was talked into watching O12 one night and I regretted it a lot The plot is not only boring but also senseless I honestly dont even know what it was all about I left the movie after 3 quarters and got some coffee with another girl who didnt like it Much more pleasure I can tell you that But even the guys who stayed till the end later reported to me that the plot continued being awful and useless My advice: Dont watch Go watch Team America (hilarious btw;-)) and forget about Oceans Twelvebr br In my opinion the most boring and senseless peace of crap to be on the screen in years
What a ridiculous waste of time and money!!!! This movie was the biggest loser of the year All the hype was a warning I am disappointed for Julia Roberts by far she is the most talented cast member I think her ability to truly act carried the film The buddy buddy boys club was a little too phony and to add insult to injury why bother to cast Catherine Zeta Jones? She only has the ability to ruin a film She lacks the ability to have on screen chemistry with anyone not to mention she lacks the ability to act She lacks chemistry with the other characters: kind of reminiscent of Americas Sweethearts She made The Terminal terminal This movie is headed nowhere what a shame please please dont tell me 13 is on the way!
Man I loved Oceans 11br br Smart movie All eleven characters were crucial to the heist as each had their own specialised skill that was necessary to pull of the grand finalebr br What on earth was Oceans 12? What was the purpose of the twelfth person? I assume its supposed to be Zeta-Jones but she wasnt really a part of the 11 as she was trying to trip them up and working against them the whole film?? It was more like the story of Brad and Zeta-Jones characters boring relationship with some bits from the original movie thrown in just to get some bums on seats to watch the moviebr br With O-11 the gang were always a step ahead of Benedict (Garcia) They were always able to outsmart him What happened here? He catches up with them after a tip-off and suddenly theyre all wusses? The whole movie is so that they can raise the money they stole plus interest to repay back Benedict for the heist they pulled on him 3 years earlier So next movie theyre going to develop courage and brains again and get him back for making them pay him back for the first heist? Puh-leasebr br This movie could have been achieved with just Brad Pitt Zeta-Jones and 5 mins of Matt Damon for the switcheroo scenebr br Slow moving movie not the energy of the first one I tried hard to like it and Im usually very easy to please but Im really disappointedbr br SPOILER!!! The twist - the whole movie didnt need to have been made as the real heist was done before everything you just saw over the past 2 hoursbr br END SPOILERbr br Wait until it comes on TV or if youre a fan of the original from 2001 please dont watch this
I was watching this movie and getting increasingly bored with the silly plot that was going nowhere when suddenly the story takes a surreal turn for the worse and has an actor playing herself Oh how I guffawed Because its sooooo funny isnt it? We know Julia Roberts is playing the character of Tess and here they are in the film cracking the joke that the character of Tess looks a bit like Julia Roberts So Julia plays someone impersonating Julia How well she does this well never know because 99999% of the audience dont actually know Julia Roberts personally (and reading about her in Hello magazine doesnt count) br br And then Bruce Willis turns up! Apparently hes Julia Roberts best friend Well he is in the film how would I know whether or not Bruce Willis and Julia Roberts even know each other? Im not in the least bit interested in the personal lives of actors - I just pay my money and expect them to do the job theyre paid to do Anyway they start cracking jokes about the plot twist in the film where Willis (rather unconvincingly) plays a psychiatrist the one with the little kid in it you know the one? I dont Ive forgotten what its called Willis even drops in a comment about how well that film did at the box office - how modest of you Mr Willis!br br The problem is that not only are these scenes pointless and horribly horribly self-indulgent it also remind us the viewers that were simply watching a bunch of actors strutting around and getting paid vast sums of money for very little effort You see when I see a movie I want to suspend disbelief and forget that Im watching actors - I want to believe in the story Im watching When you start pulling the scenery down mid- movie you simply ruin the illusion for mebr br You know that a TV series has jumped the shark when it starts introducing celebrities playing themselves (stand up and be counted The Simpsons Friends etc) but this is the first time Ive seen a movie jump the shark I usually stay away from movies like that (eg Scary Movie The Naked Gun etc) The trouble is I honestly never thought the Oceans 11 films would go in this direction What a shamebr br So with suspension of disbelief thrown out the window and the plot now languishing in the movie then cracks the most wicked joke of all on the audience - the heist actually happened way back in the story and the final 90 minutes or so of the film was pointless posturing Yes thats right: Steven Soderwhatsit and his actor friends all get up point at us the audience and say Ha haaa youve all been had thanks for your money! Then they give us the single fingered salutebr br Well right back at you I didnt actually pay to see this movie I downloaded the DVD for nothing How dya like them apples? Now THATS a plot twist
This was the biggest disappointment of a movie:( Sucks cos I was really looking forward to itbr br All the twists were crap They were ALL flashbacks!!! br br What makes a good heist movie is the BELIEVABILITY of the the job Yes it has to be surprising so the audience is stunned but if you walk away and go thats bulls#!t whats the point? br br Plus the main heist was a bag snatch anyway! You didnt get to see the team operating at its full deceptive and brilliant potential There was not even ONE good heist in this movie! They were all rubbish including that french idiots break dancing crap to get through the lasers its easy to do that when they are composited in afterwards! Plus that kind of stuff has already been done in at least one other movie and it was stupid then as wellbr br Also theres no reason to have even HALF of the 12 or 11 in this movie! What difference do half of the cast really make to the outcome of this movie??? Half the SCENES dont even need to be there! br br The first one was classy This was CHEAP! And it makes the whole team loose credibility Especially Ocean himself for bowing down the Bennett
I had read the newspaper reviews of this film and I must say my expectations were very low before watching Oceans 12 I really enjoyed the first movie but this successor is one of the worst movies ever I would rate it top 5 of the worst movie I have ever seen Why do I say that? First of all there is a story so thin that Britney Spears Crossroads looks like the perfect action thriller The fragments that could be assigned the term story is loosely held together at times but most of the time the movie just moves along with no purpose or drive The entire story seems forced and the script surrounding the story is even more forced that it become farce at timesbr br The actors show up but doesnt do anything to deserve any credit or appraise Most embarrassing are leading ladies (Roberts and Zeta-Jones) that either overplay or are extremely plain Damon Clooney and Pitt arent brilliant either To be honest I really dont understand how they would want to be associated with something as bad as this moviebr br === May contains spoilers ==== Camera and editing sigh where should I begin There are many unnecessary camera movements that just make the experience painful Combine that with extremely untactful editing and you start looking for a wooden spoon to carve your heart out Especially the scene where the entire gang is moved out of the prison to be transported away by car The camera zoom to each person just get boring and when you are at number 3 of 12 you got the message: wow you are cool and can do simple zoom effects - NOT I understand that the scene with Tess Ocean (Julia Roberts) playing Julia Roberts is supposed to be funny but it just gets extremely embarrassing and you turn away to avoid experiencing the mess Bruce Willis Why? Please explain it to me! WHY???br br To summarize  if you have to choose between root canal work and watching Oceans 12 I recommend the former Make sure they do all the teeth while you are at it 
Oceans 12 starts off on annoying and gets worse from there on Like a celebrity awards presentation each major actoractress is introduced in short 60-second scenarios that seem to stop just short having a blinking applaud now sign The first 60 minutes of the film are incredibly disjointed poorly edited and at times utterly unrelated to the story and confusing Speaking of the storythere is one kindabut its barely visible for all the look at me shots and cameos Only Matt Damon seemed to actually act during this filmthe rest of the cast appeared to only be there to participate in a rat-pack-wanna-be session As for the heist the action the dramait was put into the last 8-10 minutes of the movie and was pathetic and anticlimactic Horrible! Horrible! Horrible!
I felt compelled to write about this movie after i joined IMDb because i thought it was the worst script writing i have seen in a whilebr br The actingdirectionother-areas of the movie are fantastic I love brad Pitt with George Clooney It works The witty banter was still there too from the first movie My question is how in the world did they let this script out of the drafting process? I thought that not only did the plot develop like a slug racing to the end of the sidewalk but that twist? (can i call it that) was so incredibly stupid that i wanted to go demand a refund from the ticket booth I have never felt so played and used from a movie in my entire life Here i was expecting something similar to the first movie (good chemistry good acting good direction amazing plot) only to find that they had taking my 8 dollars and made a mockery out of itbr br The part that gets me still is that this movie has now grossed more than 125 million dollarsbr br In summary I felt that this movie insulted my intelligence I still feel like the only part the writers concentrated on was that little bit with Julia Roberts acting like Julia Roberts This movie made me sad and angry
Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) catches up with Danny Ocean and his team and demands that they repay the money that they stole from him (in Oceans 11) plus interest He holds back from violent action however as he is under the instruction of the worlds greatest thief the Night Fox The team then have to pull off a series of heists to pay Benedict back whilst testing their abilities against the Night Fox who wishes to maintain his position as the greatest thief ever Put simply this film is a complete mess The masses may argue that it is cool and that Clooney and Pitt put in great performances but these are the same people who have a subscription to Hello magazine and think that David Beckham has the potential to be a great actor The story is convoluted it is not complex or clever and it does not have intelligent twists and turns it is just a complete mess that spills out in multiple directions with the hope that the audience will think it is cool and intelligent (Hello magazine readers) Any respectable movie watcher will however see the film for the farce that it is Whilst Oceans 11 wasnt a great film it had a decent pace was stylish and had some decent twists and turns This movie loses its way very quickly and then basically gives up It is as if the director and cast said to themselves hey this isnt really working out lets just have a laugh! Indeed the cast looks like they are enjoying themselves but I was not I will not delve into the plot as its confused evolution does not warrant any examination The addition of Catherine Zeta Jones is largely annoying The scenes where Julia Roberts impersonates herself (with Bruce Willis undertaking a cameo role) whilst mildly amusing appear to be a desperate move to keep the audience interested The movie is so full of plot holes that it as if Arnie has emptied an Uzi 9mm into the film studio Credit can only be given to some scenes where the Night Fox uses Caopeira to undertake a heist against the back drop of some funky music but this is hardly justification to watch the movie The final scene features the team in a nonsensical drunken stupor; this accurately sums up the movie Stick with the original
Unfortunately I think this is one of those films that if you or I took it to the studio and said can I make this great movie with my friends Mary Mungo and Midge from school? the studio would have you kicked to death on the spot However if a bunch of massive Hollywood names say look I fancy a jaunt to Italy with my mates how about it? the studio writes a chequebr br We kick off with the casino boss from Oceans 11 tracking down the robbers who made off with his cash and then Brad Pitt is shagging Catherine Zeta Jones and then theres some monkeying about in Amsterdam and Italy and such and such and then it all ends somehowbr br The film does however include the most shameful moment of both Julia Roberts and Bruce Willis careers which is a cinematic gem I nearly vomited in my lap and tore my eyes out when Julia Roberts playing Tess in the movie pretends to be (you guessed it) Julia Roberts! Bruce Willis stands about clearly wondering when he can leave and how much the cheque will bebr br Ah well to be fair Id have done it for the cash so I suppose I cant really criticize the poor loves but Im a penniless slob not a Hollywood legend I guess what really annoys me about this film is not that it is boring and pointless and has a terrible story but that I think the actors probably all had good fun doing it! I think the actors entire job is to project emotion outwardsI feel like I paid to go to the party but had to stand outside in the rain Booo!br br Watch it if you like Como or fancy CZJ or something but otherwise go for a walk
SPOILER!! Terrible camera work horrible writing non-existent plot and numerous plot wholes Wonderful acting! Except for Julia Roberts Who poorly plays someone who is impersonating Julia Roberts poorly Catherine Zeta Jones is adorable in this moviebr br During the movie we repeatedly zoom in on each of the twelve (!) characters Twelve is too many even for a classic like 12 Angry Men And the problem is we tediously zoom in on the characters when all of them are in the same room doing the same thingbr br Yep Clooneys eating Yep Pitts eating Yep the Jew is eating Yep the geek is eating Yep the bodybuilders eating Yep Mr Sensitive is eating Yep Yep Yep Yep--Yep Yep Phew! This happens at least three other times in the movie Yep theyre all sitting in cars bored Yep theyre all getting arrested frightened Yep theyre all being led out of a jail depressedbr br But it wasnt until I was home that I realized how badly theyd got me on this one This is a heist movie right? Thats what I went to see right? But when I walked in and set my car keys in the change jar only then I realized: NOTHING WAS ACTUALLY STOLEN IN THIS MOVIE! Thats right Its a heist movie where nothing gets stolen Oh they try They go to try and steal some boring document or something from some guys house (whatever) and it turns out its already been stolen 20 minutes of my life wasted Then they try to steal some egg from some museum (YAWN!) and they screw that up and get arrestedbr br Then we see how some fairy french guy stole the egg even before they did and we get all the joy of Entrapment except this time the person inside the tight catsuit dancing around the fake lasers is an ugly skinny french guy Umbr br But it turns out he didnt actually steal the egg either Actually our heroes stole the egg LOOOONG ago in another movie entirely which would have been a GREAT movie to watch had they made that moviebr br Instead we see a 30 second clip in black-and-white about how they robbed some college student of his back-pack You heard me the daring caper the ultimate heist-- the buildup of this 2 and a half hours of utter boring crap-- is them stealing a back-pack from a college student by creatively getting into a fight over baseball teams and distracting him and replacing his back-pack with an identical back-pack? What?? br br Ugh Im telling you this was so bad I didnt even realize just how bad it was-- just how badly Id been robbed-- until I got home
Every James Bond movie has its own set of rules Just like every Indiana Jones movie has ITS own set of rules And the fact that screenwriters dont break these rules maintains the integrity of the characters With a completely unnecessary plot twist the integrity of both Ocean films plummets somewhere between Airplane 2 and a Roadrunner cartoonbr br Imagine what would happen while teetering on the rope bridge outside of the Temple of Doom if Indy told Shorty and Willie not to worry because throughout the entire first two movies hes secretly had super powers and can fly them both to safetybr br Entertaining? Sure for a Roadrunner cartoon But Spielberg would never have done that because it would have destroyed the integrity of the film More importantly it would have ANGERED the audience Theyd already sat on the edge of their seats through 3 hours worth of Indiana Jones movies and they were counting on Indiana to get them off that bridge in a believable way If he were to fly off? People would have walked out of the theaters the same way people did during Oceans 12br br SPOILERSbr br 1 Julia Robertscharacter Tess infiltrates a museum by disguising herself asJulia Roberts?!? A clever twist? By breaking the fourth wall three hours after weve been introduced to these characters? Is this the Naked Gun 33 and 13? Its a textbook example of how a cheap laugh can ruin an entire film But waitjust in case you havent walked out yetbr br 2 The suspense builds throughout the last hour of the movie -- how will they pull off the heist -- there are only 10852 DAYS LEFT! And then in the last 12 minutes of the film the ONLY entertaining part of this movie we see that the heist was made days earlier and took Matt Damon all of 30 seconds to pull off The past 10 days? A complete waste of your timebr br BACK TO INDIANA JONES ON THE ROPE BRIDGEJust relax Willie! I stole the REAL stones back about a month ago! Besides I convinced them you were Kate Capshaw!br br If you havent already seen it cut your losses and go see the Polar Express I dont want to ruin the ending for you but there really is a Santa Claus Most importantly you wont feel cheated leaving the theater
I had very high hopes walking into this movie After all Oceans 11 was a truly great Hollywood product Its rapid-fire jokes incredible star power and tight script made it one of the most fun caper films I have ever seen Of course with all the money it made a sequel was on the way and I for one was excitedbr br Needless to say I was absolutely blown away by this movie Blown away by how horribly wrong things can go This movie had everything going for it; the return of the entire original cast the same director news stories of crazy on- and off-set antics How could it possibly have gone so wrong?br br It starts immediately with one of the most awkward and unnecessary opening sequences ever and goes downhill from there After reasonably goofy short scenes between PittZeta-Jones and ClooneyRoberts the film spends several minutes watching Andy Garcia waltz from scene to scene telling each individual member of Danny Oceans original eleven that he wants his money back Believe me when I say that these scenes are only here to pad Andy Garcias running time because without these ridiculously awkward shots his screen time would be WELL under five minutesbr br This leads me to another major qualm I had with this film The pacing is so uneven that characters are dropped completely from the story and only sometimes brought back later Bernie Macs character is dropped from the script early on and never comes back except for 2 short scenes with no dialogue Garcia appears for the first few minutes and returns for an exceptionally brief scene at the end Roberts shows up for about 5 minutes at the beginning and isnt even mentioned again until theres about 20-25 minutes left Even Clooney himself spends a large chunk of the film in prisonbr br This would all be excusable if the film was funny At all 90% of the jokes fall completely flat and the ones that do work are worth a chuckle at best The plot is undeniably worthless and left me feeling cheated At one point in the film the team takes on a job worth $25 million of the nearly $100 million they need to raise before Garcias two-week deadline Several characters even acknowledge how absurd wasting the time to do this job is but they do it anyway! Over 30 minutes of the film revolve around this job that they shouldnt even be doing and one gets the feeling that this part of the plot was simply added to pad the running time Furthermore the equipment they use to pull this job off CLEARLY cost millions upon millions to fund Just wait until you see what they do to pull this job and realize it would cost far more than $25 million to pull off Obviously because of this they have to pull off several jobs to make the money The beauty of the first film was the one big con and how ingeniously and intricately it was pulled off Here they pull so many jobs in so many different ways that they rush through all of them because to explain them would make the film several hours longbr br We all know walking into this film that there will be a big twist at the end Thus is the nature of the caper film The twist at the end of Oceans Twelve made me laugh; not because it was funny but because I couldnt believe how cheated I felt I wont give it away because I know most of you will be foolish enough to throw down the money to see this movie anywaybr br What I will say is that it makes most of the 2 hours you have sat through already completely irrelevantbr br I was excited to see this film after absolutely adoring Oceans 11 I left the theater feeling like I had been the victim of a truly great con pulled by the cast and crew of this movie in tricking me into thinking that this movie would actually be worth watching I have never given a 1 to a movie on IMDbcom but theres a first time for everything Consider yourselves warned110
I thought it was comedy!! What a hoot! I cant believe Forsythe or Reynolds would actually appear in this piece of trashAnd then theres the beautiful Erika Eleniak or whatever this piece of eye candy is calledAppears she put on a few pounds since her Playboy centerfoldLike about 50!! The story line is ludicrous the acting absolutely horrendous and the tired old clichés that are run over and over and over again boy it took a lot of stamina to sit through this dogThe only thing worth it was the LAUGHS!! And there are PLENTY! If you really want to kill say an hour and a half pick this baby up at the rental shop but make sure you have a room full of brain dead people to watch it with you I think thats who it was written for it plays like they were thinking of a real low rent drug induced audience for this one
QUESTION: How does a film merit two different titles like The Librarians and Strike Force? br br ANSWER: The film is sooooooooo bad that the filmmakers couldnt even decide on a title!!!! br br This film is a hodgepodge of martial arts death wish-vendettas melodrama romance and other cliché film techniques The story focuses on a vigilante group called The Librarians led by Agent Simon (WIlliam Forsythe) The group is hot in pursuit of a nefarious multi-lingual pockmarked creature named Marcos (Andrew Divoff) who captures women and holds them hostage in the lawless urban world of south Florida br br Burt Reynolds appears as a cameo in this film and his scene is entirely extraneous to the action Burt delivers a long monologue in one of the strangest drawls I have ever heard This may have been Burts attempt at an Irish dialect but the overall effect is a kind of perverse imitation of Marlon Brando in The Godfather br br Also appearing in this film is Erika Eleniak who has infiltrated the inner circle of Marcos bizarre world Erikas character kick-boxes her way into an alliance with Simon The Librarians and Erika will become a powerful strike force against evil in a film that has been delivered directly from the editing room to your cable TV converter box

As stated by others this is a ludicrously horrible movie (NOT A FILM!) It is not bad in a funny way just painful to try to endure Dont waste your timebr br Erika Eleniak is pretty hot but there is one scene where she is in a bathtub and you can see the wrap covering her breasts under the bubbles Also shes getting fatbr br The fight scenes are so bad as to be unwatchable if you know or care anything about martial arts or even decent choreography and the editingeffects are abysmalbr br There is no payoff it goes nowhere and sucks getting there
I heard the stories of the ravers in the movie and thats great but that is only 1100 of the movie The problem with this movie is the cheesiness I never really got the plot or why the guy was stealing girls That makes no sense but heywhy they were in a club randomly was curious also Many parts of this movie make no sense but overall I was interested It was confusing on many levelsmaybe I am just not indie enough for this movie but judging from the B looking end scene they ran out of money just cut some stuff in and forgot about the plot Its low budget and appears so I like the fact that they used little special effects which were bad but they used none that were quality I would say this film is the quintessential bad script with alright production It is definitely not as random as many movies I have seen but the pieces of the puzzle just dont make sense together In effects I would give exception to the final battle when all the effects went 1950s on my ass Sparks out of models and the like Watch it if you like an unintentional comedy from an action movie Mystery science theater has a candidate
Recap: Simon leads a little team of special agents that has specialized in finding and returning missing people against all possible odds Their latest mission is about the granddaughter of a friend of them She seems to have been caught in the web of a particularly brutal criminal and everyone that has gone looking for her has gone missing But now The Librarians are on the casebr br Comments: This is pure B-action through and through The key phrase for this is unlimited supply There is unlimited supply of ammunition they dont have to reload once There is an unlimited supply of bad guys so the heroes have something to shoot at There is an unlimited supply of breasts many of them bare in an vain (and as always failed) attempt to distract from the plot holes And there is an unlimited supply of bad acting (it is almost like Erika Eleniaks performance shines in this what about that?) and actors that dont seem to care more than the paycheck (and why should they when no one else seem to?)br br And as in most B-action movies there are an unlimited supply of bad gunfights But these almost seem to be of a ridiculously bad kind I think I saw more realistic gunfights when I played cowboy as a kidbr br But then again I didnt really expect much either how could I from a action movie named The Librarians? And it actually delivers about what could be expected 90 minutes of more or less bad action with some scenes to connect the dots between But I am unsure if I can call it entertaining it didnt keep my interest very longbr br 310
Like a terrible cancer raining out of the sky I wandered into this crock on some movie channel the other night Being a fan of bad movies and actively engaging in the purchasing and viewing of said bad film i was intrigued by the idea of a genuinely terrible looking action movie coming from modern times After that wore off though I found my hands inexplicably turning against me grabbing at anything in range and stabbing about my head and neck Something sinister was in that tapeerrwhere was Ianyway this ranks among the more embarrassingly bad pieces of film Ive run across William Forsythe cant play more than one character and that character is always a walking joke Even when set into a comic background and given things to do and say that are supposed to be funny (ala Deuce Bigalo) hes laughable in the wrong way Erika Eleniak is much the same having starred in her fair share of terrible movies and done terrible jobs in all of them she doesnt fail to help scum up this one Classic b-movie villain guy Andrew Divoff does a respectable job but barely even has any scenery to chew on Even reliable standby for b-movie action Daniel Bernhardt fails to deliver anything bordering on entertainment As for the films own merits the plot is lame the script just like the action and the plot movement is both dull andwell stupid for lack of a better adjective(lord knows they didnt put any effort into it why should I?)br br Anyone who has seen enough movies has seen some bad ones and anyone who has seen enough bad ones can learn to appreciate them but there is simply nothing here to be enjoyed unless you are among the most bad movie tolerant and simply feel so inclined as to test your mettle Before you do though take it from me this one isnt even terrible enough to be enjoyed (unlike saysome of the more ludicrous Italian zombie films) A fan of b-movie action would be much better off checking out most any of Bernhardts other films or pretty much anything else that has ever been put to film for that matter America simply is not the place to go to for action it seems especially not now If you have a craving check out anything from over the seas films like Heroic Duo or the slightly less normal Hakaider(along with anything else in the awesome Keita Amemiyas cannon) will provide a lot more fun and way better action than your apt to find elsewhere especially here
Im not going to bother mentioning any of the plot - this is strictly a B movie on its way to obscurity The shock to me though is seeing what has become of some of the actors in this film Erika Eleniak never anything youd call a thespian anyway seems to have morphed into Anna Nicole Smith (in her Big period) Daniel Bernhardt - I almost shed a tear Hes always been a favorite of mine because of his martial arts prowess as seen in the Bloodsport series (also B movies but if you like martial arts eminently watchable) Here he is a shell of his former self - sure hes older but doing the mercenary thing and not even looking interested  I just dont get it Dont these people invest? William Forsythe is another heavy that Ive always liked but his last several roles are what you would call mailing it in Im not going to even mention Mr Reynolds - his gig here amounts to a throwaway nothing more The only winner is Andrew Divoff as usual a creepy evil pockmarked villain with a sandpaper voice that can curdle milk - the best kind! This is a movie you watch for laughs Theres nothing else to it
OK imagine that every state in the US nay every country has exactly the same trees growing and ground foliage Imagine also that a monkey-trappers camp so far off the beaten track you had to do the first half of the approach by river has a beautifully tarmacd perfectly straight road leading up to it Imagine a world where you have to wear a full biohazard suit to collect a floppy disk then you just drop it in a ziploc bag and transfer it to your pocket with no precautions as soon as you get back to the office A world where two nine-year old girls are happy to give lots of blood without complaining This is the world this movie is set inbr br On top of that its one of the most cliché-ridden pieces of excrement its been my misfortune to witness in many a yearbr br I liked it :)
Ive been hearing a lot of this new bird flu that has killed dozens of people in South East Asia over the last three years  Apparently its on the thresh hold of mutating into something very contagious and millions upon millions of people are going to be wiped out in a global pandemic  Just thought Id mention this in case you havent got round to writing your will yet br br Id also thought Id mention it since I was watching something called CARRIERS tonight which wasnt about naval warfare but opens with a scene thats a cross between OUTBREAK and an episode of THE X FILES I saw many years ago  I thought Id be watching something with added resonance after hearing the stories about the danger posed by bird flu but after the not unimpressive opening CARRIERS descends into a cheap and cheerful TVM and like every other TVM youll see the lead characters are female  one of which is a ballsy authority figure while the other lead female is a mother of young children  It goes without saying theres a sick child subplot too br br What is irritating about the TVM format is that it overwhelms the potential of what could have been quite a good film if it was made for cinema  Theres a fairly gory scene of someone coughing blood all over a nurses face and a very impressive jay walker getting run down stunt but these bits are quickly forgotten as the mood descends into family sentiment since this - And just about every other TVM ever made - was made for an essentially female audience
Ive watched the first 15 minutes and I can tell that there was no consultation with any military type personnel Judith Lights charactor (an officer) has her hair down past her shoulders! One of the first officers that greets her as she walks in to the medical facility she works at is so overweight that his pant pockets gap! No - there was no military advising them on this movie Even an ex-military enlisted could have assisted here
How can you make a joke about Mafia? It is not the kind of subject to laugh at! A near movie cannot make me laugh because I am comparing it to Jane Austens Mafia! Mafia! wasnt a good movie but Hoods is really worse! In Mafia! there were some good jokes but in this one there are maybe two or threethat make you smile Not too bad actors but very bad scenario!! We sure prefer something serious like The Godfather I give it  out of 
Hoods doesnt deliver the goods This half-baked mafia comedy boasts a stellar cast including Joe Mantegna Kevin Pollack Joe Pantoliano Jennifer Tilly and Seymour Cassel along with a number of faces familiar to those who watch crime movies but it is truly a misfire if there ever was one Writer & director Mark Malone best known for writing Dead of Winter for Bonnie & Clyde director Arthur Penn has penned up a pedestrian potboiler that has an ailing but vengeful mob boss Louie Martinelli (Seymour Cassel) dispatching his son Angelo (Joe Mantegna of House of Games) to whack Carmine DellaRosa It seems that a rival mob fire-bombed one of Pops warehouses (in the opening scene) and Martinelli wants payback Trouble is that nobody has a clue as to who Carmine DellaRosa is In any other mob comedy such a complication might be amusing but here is just plain flat Angelo and a carload of wiseguys including his best pal Rudy (Kevin Pollack of Deterrence) spend half of the time trying to find out who Carmine is Neither Rudy nor Angelo want to perform the hit so they track down a crazy mob hit-man Charlie (Joe Pantoliano of Bad Boys) to do the dirty deed Before they can convince Charlie to make the hit they have to locate him and Charlies slutty wife Mary (Jennifer Tilly of Bound) reveals that he is locked up in a mental hospital Our misfit heroes cruise out to the mental hospital and break Charlie out About half of the movie is over before they discover that Carmine is a kid in short pants (Vincent Berry) who is bland and harmless Indeed Carmine has the only decent line in the movie As our brainless bunch of heroes wheel away from his house with him in the backseat to take care of business Carmine warns them that they need to get him home in time or his father will kill him Charlie tries to ice the urchin but he cannot Instead he reconnects with his feelings and wants to go back to the mental hospital so he can report the good news to his doctor Meanwhile after Charlie decides not to shoot Carmine the kid gets his paws on the pistol and pops off several aimless rounds Angelo and he struggle over the automatic The pistol slips out of their collective hands and hits the ground goes off and blows a hole in Rudys chest Now keep in mind that Rudy never wanted to shoot the kid in the first place and Angelo and he argued over the wrong-headedness of the hit So Rudy winds up on the ground with a fatal wound while Angelo struggles to stop the bleeding Talk about a dull death scene Angelo is conflicted himself because his father ordered the hit and Angelo fears that dad will do him in if he doesnt execute orders There is a flashback subplot about Angelos father teaching him how to handle a gun that provides some insight into Angelos reluctance to pack a gunbr br There is nothing remotely redeeming about this depressing comedy with a downer of an ending Things gets worse and if you last through this 90 minute nonsense youll see what I mean The comedy is largely laugh-less Good actors wallow in sketchy roles that arent even funny Perhaps director Malone was trying to do another comedy like The Gang That Couldnt Shoot Straight If he was he missed by a mile Big-breasted Jennifer Tilly shows cleavage and snarls through a couple of scenes with Mantegna but she doesnt do much of anything else Shes the stereotypical slut who doesnt even get naked A paycheck is the only way to explain the presence of such a talented cast otherwise this picture is pathetic from start to finish Initially I had hoped that this might be a Ransom of Red Chief knockoff where the kid drives the wiseguys nuts but no such luck here Of course the biggest surprise is that they have to kill a kid but its not the kind of a surprise that makes you want to watch it up to its resolutionbr br I actually bought this movie on a Canadian DVD labelSevilleand it contains only the most basic special features If you hate previews that give away the plot dont watch the trailer If you ever meet Joe Mantegna one of your first questions should be why he helped to produce this yawner It is neither hilarious nor dramatic There are no quotable lines and none of the characters stand out as either interesting or sympathetic The Seville DVD presents the movie in full frame with no subtitles or closed captioning
Jefferey dahmer was one sick guy Theres not much to say about him that hasnt already been said except that the many documentaries and films made about him are probably better than this one Its Ridiculously cheesy Its so cheesy a guy who posted the whole film on youtube added some annotations to make the viewer laughbr br Carl Crew (Whos he?) stars as Serial killer Jeffrey dahmer Whos killing spree began in 1978 with a young guy dahmer just wanted to be friends with a finally in 1991 with a man he wished to have sex with and eatbr br I didnt bother to watch the whole film through its basically a documentary that shows all the attacks dahmer pulled off before he got caught And since this film was made in 1993 one year before dahmer was bludgeoned to death by a fellow inmate The death of dahmer isnt shown but it Probably wouldve been as cheesy as this cheese-festbr br 110
Possible spoilersbr br Ive read up on Dahmer a little and saw the new Dahmer film (with the same name) at an earlier time This movie here concentrates rather much on the victims and killings too little on Dahmer himself The film called Dahmer had the opposite problem it was too little about his crimes and too much about himselfbr br I did not find the acting to my satisfaction it had a certain amateur feel too it especially the probation officer It also seemed as if the Dahmer acting got worse every time he played against the probation officer actor But I might be wrong about thatbr br What annoyed me a bit was that some of the scenes were quite disturbing but that the filmmakers seemed to try and show the real deal about what he did anyway That is ok - but what I then dont understand is why the guy who ran away from his flat while Dahmer was out getting beer was not depicted being naked since that is also how it happened Its not a big deal but it just eats away further on the movies quality that such details are left out What wasnt shown either or not even really hinted was Dahmers sexual obsession with the dead Again I dont mind they didnt SHOW it but at least they could have mentioned it or built it in to the movie somehowbr br Conclusion: I think the really good Dahmer film is still to be made a movie that incorporates not only Dahmers crimes but also who he was and why he did what he did I think that 15 or 2 hours are just not enough to grasp the complexity of it all This movie was just a cutout (excuse the pun) of Dahmers life and personality and does not give you any close to good insight into his life or personalitybr br 410
The Secret Life starts with the worst possible narrative intro: The crimes committed by Jeffrey Dahmer are too horrible to make a film about Okay so what are you suggesting? That we shouldnt bother to continue watching as the film wont be accurate or bloody anyway? And they were right too! The film isnt the least bit shocking and contains almost no blood or gore at all Although I think thats mainly due to the low budget production values and not because of Dahmers crimes being too horrific Basically The Secret Life: Jeffrey Dahmer is just one sequence repeated over and over again Young pitiful and mentally confused Jeffrey picks up victims (always males as he was a homosexual) kills them and then talks about how it wasnt his intention to hurt them and about how lonely he is This gets boring really quick and even the admirable performance by unknown actor Carl Crew cant save this movie from being a total dud Still this version is much better than the pretentious and hopelessly muddled Dahmer that got released in 2002
This movie has been done before It is basically a unoriginal combo of Napoleon Dynamite and Sordid Lives There are some funny bits but otherwise it is a cliché bore It is a good first film attempt and the director (who also stars in and wrote the feature) shows a lot of promise But the writing was kind of choppy and the story was not very original I swear I had heard some of the lines in other films However the acting was very good and the film was shot in an interesting way It is also refreshing to see gay-themed movies not be so bogged down with political correctness and tired stories of angst The main character seemed fairly well adjusted for a gay teen in rural Texas so no saccharine coming out drama here!
I wasted enough time actually WATCHING this chore of a movie I dont want to waste more writing a big review Not once did I so much as crack a smile ALL the jokes were boring forced and lacked any kind of wit I kept saying wheres the punchline? Almost every single character was an obnoxious stereotype and all the situations were clichéd and half the time there wasnt even any kind of solution Things just happened to get to the next scene For the life of me I cant understand how this got as many good reviews as it did If you like clunky acting and poorly composed film making Fat Girls is the movie for you
The premise of the film was very promising - sort of a gay Napoleon Dynamite type of film And to be fair there were some funny moments and funny lines but it really wasnt very good overall The script and dialog felt like a local sketch production full of clichés and scenes that were predictablebr br However there was enough that was amusing that I stuck around to see how it finished since there were hints that something special happens at the end But it seems that either the film ran out of money or the writer ran out of ideas because the ending is extremely abrupt almost skipping directly from what looked to be the key conflict in the film to the final creditsbr br Overall it was very disappointing but not completely unwatchable
Fat Girls is among the worst films within the indie gay genrebr br The premise is promising: an average-looking gay teen is trapped in a repressive small TX town His only kindred spirits are the other village HS misfits: the class fat girl a naïve immigrant from Cuba and the sensitive drama teacher So far interesting In theory this plot line creates a decent setup for an appealing coming of age story with a built-in audience---the thousands of gay men who grew up in small towns across America and experienced this adolescent anxiety first hand peppered with a dose of self-deprecating humorbr br Unfortunately rather than a nuanced dramedy Ash Christian approaches his autobiographical subject matter with a poorly executed attempt at irony and dark humor The result is a cast of unlikeable derivative two-dimensional characters which the viewer cannot but help feel indifferent toward Sabrina (Fink) is a quasi-Goth bitter navel-gazer She is such a prickly unsympathetic person; there is little doubt as to the reason for her friendless condition The chemistry between her and Rodney (Christian) registers zero This may have been bad casting but is more likely due to a screenplay which is simply unsalvageable Consequently one is left wondering when there is such a non-existent bond what could possibly warrant their near-constant companionship throughout the storybr br Sabrinas newfound boyfriend Rudy (de Jesus) and Rodneys mother Judy (Theaker) are among the most exaggerated of the clichéd stock characters ripped off from dozens of other films Rudy is the horny undersexed immigrantnerd lifted directly from every raunchy adolescent comedy ever made within the realm of TV or film Judy is the born-again obsessed with Jesus- talk and big hair Just when you thought the Tammy Faye thing had been done to death Christian inserts a scene where Judys mascara is running with her tears! Is there anyone in the civilized world that can possibly think this tired old stereotype gag is still funny after seeing it ad nauseum for 20 years?br br In addition to the failed attempts at sardonic humor there are many puzzling story inconsistencies Rodney considers himself a fat ugly loser However he simultaneously manages to participate in casual and regular impromptu trysts with the ubiquitous school jockhunk Ted (Miller) Although these liaisons are devoid of emotional fulfillment most gay teens (filled with raging testosterone just like their hetero brethren) would find this to be a rather enviable arrangement given the more common alternative of involuntary celibacybr br Rodney finds an object for his affection in Bobby (Bruening) an exotic transplant from England Against all believable odds the lad not only happens to land in this tiny TX hamlet but is conveniently openly gay to boot Like Sabrina Bobby is an icy angry smart aleck and the viewer is left head-scratching as to his magnetic appeal br br Much to his delight Rodney is invited by his new crush to the town gay bar where Bobby claims to be the DJ Upon arrival the boyfriend-to-be promptly leaves Rodney solo and heads off to another area of the bar for a quick encounter with a rather handsome young man This is yet one more of the ridiculously inexplicable plot elements since Rodneys feeling as an outcast are supposedly derived largely from his lonely existence in a parochial town As tiny as the town is they have openly gay students at the high school? A secretly bisexual football captain? Lesbian moms? A Gay teacher? and it has a gay bar downtown (patronized by attractive men no less)? Apparently the place is not so backwater after allbr br Ten years earlier Todd Stephens Edge of Seventeen covered nearly the same material with a much more creative honest touching and humorous film
I checked this out at the Vancouver International Film Festival and was not impressedbr br The only area of the film I enjoyed was the commentary on film-making For the most part this film seemed random and somewhat fantastical (I dont say that in a complimentary way however) and just silly It was as if he was mixing fantasy with everyday life which may sounds intriguing in some films but the fantasy merely seemed needlessly perversebr br My criticism of this film is not upon the actors rather the story itself I found it boring and narcissistic I wanted my money back but considering it was a Film Festival that wasnt about to happen
This would have to rate as one of the worst films of all time The film screened at the Italian Film Festival in Melbourne Australia After the screening not only did I want my money refunded I wanted the 15 wasted hours of my life back too I have a very broad tolerance level when it comes to the indulgences of some European film-making but this is one of those films that is selected for festivals based on the reputation of the filmmaker alone This film is proof that while such selections may satisfy the egos of the film-maker and the selection panel there is absolutely no joy for the audience There is no character development whatsoever the plot is a garbled mess the style is nonsensical the shot selection is appalling and the editing is worse By the end of the first reel youll wonder if you walked into the wrong cinema and by the end of the third reel youll be begging to be put out of your misery This film is an abomination
I agree that this film is too pretentious and it is not easy to know where it is going I have been teaching literature and film for many years and I find this film to be one of the most over rated according to some of the previous reviews here br br However let me remind you that this is the same director who has Lora di religione (Il sorriso di mia madre- My Mothers Smile) to his credit -- a gem of a film! br br Was he trying to outdo Fellinis 812 here???? The scene with the dogs which has also been pointed out is absurd and excessive  just one example Others would take too much space and some reviewers have already noted them br br Overall a most frustrating and annoying experience!
The film made no sense to me whatsoever Good actors(SergioCastellittoaparticular favourite; he was great in Uomo DelleStelleTheStarmakerbut that was made by Giuseppe Tornatore a great Italian director as opposed to the mediocre one who made this effort)but awful rambling script terrible editingand a director who seemed to have no idea of what he was trying to say and ended up saying exactly nothing Apretentious load of rubbish but the sort of film that certain Italianpseudo-intellectuals whom it was my misfortune to have known in the dim and distant past would have loved it and unfortunately Italy has no monopoly on these they can be found everywhere and probably acclaim this as a great masterpiece I never thought much of Bellochio as director I remember seeing his first film PugniNella TascaFists in the Pocket (or some such title) in Rome when it was first shown close on 50 years ago (I was living thereat the time) All the usual pseudos raved about it but it left me pretty cold I didnt think he was much of a director then and still dont Age has certainly not improved him and this film must rank as one of his worst
We were excited to rent this one after reading a few reviews and seeing that it scored so highly here Well we got it home and could not believe what we saw Its basically comes off as if its written by some hard up perverted old guy who could not help inserting his sexual frustrations and fantasies into an anime film that really lacks in plot and humor The main character is all over the place one moment he is like an immature little kid the next moment he is mature and intelligent then heroic then a perverted stalkerbr br The worst part is all of the out of place sexual content I have no problem with sex and dig a movie that has some good sexual energy but this is just presented in a way that is creepy Nipple slips close ups of a girls crotch (many times) in white panties or a swimsuit It was totally out of place and it seemed as if the person who wrote it was trying to live out some fantasies through his cartoon characters br br We were expecting something of a mature nature but we just kept looking at each other and asking what the heck the point of this was besides jiggling cartoon boobs and poor dialogue If you want to see some cartoon characters cleavage and crotchs this is for you If you are looking for something beyond that this movie was empty The characters and dialogue were just plain irritatingbr br 
On Halloween a town is terrorized by a lunatic with a big pumpkin for a head Bad acting compromised mostly of local talent and laughable special effects makes this one baaaaad B-Movie Queen Linnea Quigley looks embarrassed to be a part of this one and even her considerable charm which has helped so many of her other films cant help this one Pass this cheesy flick if you are looking for a good Halloween horror film and rent Night of the Demons which also stars Ms Quigley
I can not believe I even wasted a NetFlix rental on this complete piece of CRAP How long did it take to make this film? 15 minutes? On a budget of what? Fifteen bucks? I can spend a few hours with my Sony Camcorder and come up with something better than this treacherous lump of bile and its even available on DVD!?!! A very sad thing to think classics like The Stepfather have not been released on DVD but this chunk of steaming dung makes it to the format Heres hoping my rating of ONE ONE ONE ONE makes the overall (already) pathetic rating of 25 go DOWN
Jack-O (1995) was a really bad movie we are talking snoozefest x 100 no entertainment value whatsoever no budget no gore Z-grade actors etc etc this film was an awful addition to the horror movie industry and shouldnt have been made!!! The only reason i purchased this movie was because i knew Linnea Quigley was in it and sure enough she does her obligatory nude shower scene which is lovely yesbr br But as for the film itself i fell asleep at the 40 minute stage and had NO desire at all to finish it its just bigtime lame OKbr br I love horror movies im an avid fan a MASSIVE fan i love low budget horrors i love it all but i hated this rubbish so i think that will tell you all you need to know about JACK-Obr br I give this movie 210 the 2 is for the 2 minute Linnea shower scene the movie itself is a total ZERO!!!!
OK I could only find three reasons to consider this film worthwhile considering the extremely low budgetbr br First there was Linnea Quigley and Rachel Carter Actually the two of them gave me four good reasons to watch and watch I didbr br The only other reason to watch is that a lot of was filmed right down the road Now I didnt know this beforehand but I saw an Orange County car tag and said wow! this was shot in Floridabr br I was impressed by the flashback to the past and the ancestors of the young kid but that was really it The killings by the pumpkin man were pretty lame with the exception of the bikerbr br If you want to see Quigley and Carter OK but Return of the Living Dead will give greater thrills
Warning Might contain spoilersbr br i just sadly spent 5 bucks on this movie on amazon and i wish i never spent it I have never seen suck horrible special affects or acting I mean Jack-0 is just a laughable monster and his costume looks like something u could buy at a Halloween store or make yourself The acting is just horrible especially Sean Kelly i mean come on he is so pathetic with his little lines COme get me PUmpkinman low i laughed so hard on this its just stupid I mean the movie is so awful they had to put a few minutes of nudity in it just for people not to shut it off low I think the most laughable scene is when the woman sticks a butter knife in the toaster and gets electrocuted I mean come on that looked so fake and the dummy i could buy that at any Halloween store or make it myself Well I recommend not watching this cheesy movie cause it will be time you will never get back
Three delinquents disturb the tomb of an ancient warlock who after summoning Jack-O (a less then menacing pumpkin-headed figure) to dispatch said hoodlums continues on his sworn vengeance to kill every decedents of the family that offed him That includes young Sean Kelly and his horror-loving family Of course its up to Sean to find a way to save the daybr br Such a stupid low-budget B-movie The actings atrocious and the plot isnt much better Throw in a extremely lame killer a possible pedophile who laughs way too much & a couple of stereotypical cardboard cutout conservative couple and you have this film in a nutshell Not really worth your time save to see how superbly well Linnea is aging br br Eye Candy: Linnea Quigley is always good for some T&A and she doesnt disappoint here with a lengthy shower scene; Rachel Carter also gets topless (although it could be a body double)br br My Grade: D-
My mother and I rented this gem a few years ago while she was here visiting for Thanksgiving I have rarely laughed so hard This is a typical low-budget horror movie with dumb special effects a worse plot and even worse acting But are you really expecting a classic when Linnea Quigley receives top billing? I thought notbr br Since this movie does have some entertainment value I give it a 3 out of 10
If you are in search of a masochistic thrill rent this movie and show it to a group of your friends sober This movie is just plane lame but there not completely without value The brief tits are nice and there is one victims death that is funny as hell Other than that this is straight garbage But it is still better than Grim or Spookies
If you are looking for a cinematic masterpiece this aint it If you are looking for one of those awful movies that are so horrible that they are actually good then this may be for you There are so many unintentional laughs in this film that it could almost be considered a comedy Lets start with the opening titles that say Jack-O and then add the word Lantern as if the viewer wasnt able to figure out the movie was about a pumpkin by the giant pumpkin shown on both the cover and in the opening scene of the movie After that the movie goes in about 20 different directions none of which make much sense Jack-o is everywhere hes in peoples houses in the woods and yet he doesnt ever seem to do much of anything He does make a few kills but the long buildup to those killings is so poorly acted and constructed you almost wish Jack-o would take out his rage on you the viewer Other than that the plot consists of poor acting gratuitous nudity and a ridiculous plot line The acting in this film is among the worst Ive ever seen in my 35 plus years of movie-watching The boy who is the lead in the film (the directors son) has about as much emotion as a corpse and just about all of the other actorsactresses are just as bad for numerous reasons (especially the bug-eyed lady with eyes bigger than saucers) But having said all this if you take this for what it is (that is a steaming pile of dung) then you will get a few laughs from this movie What I also found amusing is that the makers of the DVD saw fit to release a 10th Anniversary Version of this movie (as if the original wasnt good enough) And someone actually had the idea of making a behind the scenes mini film which is also included in the 10th anniversary edition (Im not sure why)Ill give this 3 smashed pumpkins out of 10
I hope this group of film-makers never re-unites
Wow! What a movie if you want to blow your budget on the title and have it look real bad ask the guys that made this movie on how to do that They could have spent the money on a good rewrite or something else Or they could have spent it on beer when they made this movie at least it would have come out better
Ugh Pretty awfulbr br Linnea Quigley gets top billing but her character doesnt have a big part Who is her character supposed to be anyway the little boys aunt? Another user commented on her getting nude in a shower scene While there was a shower scene in the movie it was a head and shoulders shot Perhaps there are some alternate versions of this moviebr br Quigley does have a bigger part than John Carradine Cameron Mitchell and Brinke Stevens though Carradine shows up briefly in a monkish robe reciting vague dialog No other characters are in the scene with him though hes sort of composited in or else there are over-the-shoulder shots unquestionably belonging to someone else Theres also a really bad photo of him in a cameo locket (it looks like a bad photocopy) and a decent picture of him in a family bible He conjured up Jack-O originally or something like thatbr br Cameron Mitchell briefly shows up on a TV as a TV horror host Brinke Stevens is in the movie hes showing The Coven in which she runs around a cemetery in a robe Evidently theres more of the Brinke footage as a bonus feature on the Retromedia DVD double feature Mark of the WitchThe Brides Wore Bloodbr br Jack-O: whats it about? Darn if I know A little boy is told a story about a pumpkin-headed demon killer and he and some other kids are scared by a woman they think is a witch for some reason She follows him home and offers to help his family with their haunted garage for Halloween (put your hand through a hole and feel eyeballs that are actually grapes etc) The pumpkin-headed killer shows up several times to hold onto branches while he watches people or hold his scythe in front of the camera and pose with it for a while Sometimes he manages to do more than just stand around holding things and actually kills peoplebr br There are also some flashbacks to a western or prairie family with the little boy playing the little boy in that family too: ancestors of his I think I think they figure into Jack-Os backstory but Im not sure howbr br The little boy is ostensibly the main character but we dont really learn anything about him except that he wears glasses has nightmares and will fight bullies even if hell get beat up in the process More time should have been spent establishing his character I couldnt have cared less if he diedbr br Not recommended not even for Halloween
In Halloween three friends seek an ancient cemetery in the suburb for fun and remove a cross from a tomb where Jack-O was buried many years ago by the farmer Arthur Kelly The evil creature is unleashed kills the trio and seeks the descendants of the Kelly family for revengebr br The cheesy Jack-O is a combination of a terrible story with awful acting I was curious with the name of John Carradine in the credits and I can not imagine how a relative authorizes the use of archive footage in such a bad movie showing a total lack of respect with the name of this great actor It is impressive how bad the acting is shifting the film to a comedy instead of the proposed horror genre This is the type of movie good to see with a group of friends drinking beer making comments and laughing a lot My vote is threebr br Title (Brazil): Jack-O  Demônio do Halloween (Jack-O  Demon of the Halloween)
This thing it shouldnt be called a film is almost worse than Manos but you just have to see it its hilarious If you see it at video store rent it if you see the 10th anniversary edition yes there is a special edition for under $10 buy it if your friend has it borrow it you just have to see this The acting is so bad and the gore is is so fake After viewing this youll be asking yourself why did they make this insult of the art of film? Thats assuming your face doesnt melt off like the Naziss in Raiders  If you manage to see this be sure to vote this movie as 1 (awful) so it can make the bottom 100 it really deserves a spot there Im surprised its not number 1 right now
This is without a doubt the most hilarious movie Ive ever seen Seriously if the makers of this movie are ever discovered theyll put guys like Jim Carrey out of a job Rent Jack-O tonight! Believe me you wont regret it!
When you watch low budget horror movies as much as I do you get to where you can tell who was involved in creating the movie as each film-maker adds his own flavor to the cheese Such is the case with Jack-O When I watched this truly awful movie I was left with the undeniable feeling that Fred Olen Ray was involved maybe not as director but in some fashion and as I researched I found that I was correct Only Fred and a handfull of others could write something this pathetic and this movie just reeked of Fred Olen Ray Unless you like Fred Olen Ray (and God only knows why anyone would)avoid this movie If youre going to rent an Olen Ray pic rent Hollywood Chainsaw Hookers its the only bright shining star in Olen Rays dark cheesey universe of terrible movies
I bought Jack-O a number of months ago at a Blockbuster video sale and at the time I wasnt expecting anything outstanding from it Upon watching it I realized I not only got less than I could have ever bargained for but a whole lot more as well It seems strange I know And it is But its perfectly fitting when you consider that the utter weirdness that is Jack-Obr br The movie follows a young boy named Shawn Kelly Somehow thru ancestral ties he is marked for death at the hands of a demented scythe wielding Pumpkin man This pumpkin man was killed by Shawns Great-grandfather-uncle-cousin-etc and now that the villain has been resurrected Shawns death is apparently crucial to his hell-bred mission of vengeance Anyway much horror ensues as Jack-O hacks his way thru various neighbors before battling Shawn to the finishbr br Im not so much here to discuss the plot as I am to determine who may find any worth in this movie I can honestly tell you that Jack-O is one of the most poorly made movies in the history of time The acting is deadpan (except when it should be) the script is apparently a 1st grade group project and the production budget must not have exceeded $150 Some of the most laughable death scenes are carried out in this anti-thriller and theyre all the more humorous when you realize director Steve Latshaw actually seems serious in his movie-makingbr br And yet I heartily enjoyed the film I can call it a terrible horror movie yes But I can also say I had a great time watching it with my friends and have watched it several times since that fateful first viewing Many people (including some of my friends) will find this movie intolerable and needlessly time-consuming and thats understandable If youre like me and enjoy ridiculously bad horror movies that take themselves seriously youll find Jack-O an instant classic which is also understandablebr br Thats why its so hard to rate this movie If I were rating Jack-Os quality as a film I wouldnt give it anything In fact the studio would owe me stars Yet if I were rating its on the basis of pure enjoyment Id give it an 8 or a 9 Ill give it a 4 so to be somewhere in the middle I recommend everyone go out rent this and form their own conclusion
Ive always loved horror flicks From some of the usual well-known like The Exorcist to some of the more underrated like Black Christmas or Just Before Dawn But who are people kiddingeven calling this trash a b-movie Its straight up bottom-of-the-barrel Z-grade The acting is the worst ever on film ReallyIve seen better on an episode of the Young and the RestlessSPOILERLookout for when the woman comes to tell them about the legend of Jack-o She pauses sometimes for a matter of seconds as if someone is flashing her cue cards and shes struggling to read her lines A RIOT! br br Ohand besides the bad actingabsolutely no gore or FX And Jack-o looked like a plastic lit pumpkin Watch Linnea Quigley in Night of the Demonsor Silent NightDeadly Nightfar superior flicks
Man this movies sucked It appeared to have like seven different plots going on at once and they all made little to no sense The special effects costumes and all that stuff were beyond awful The acting was particullary bad Everything seemed so forced especially the lines from the woman with the huge eyes and the little kid (his Noooooo as he gets burried is so unenthusiastic its laughable) A good portion of this movie is rather funny anyway The one womans death where she shoves a knife into a toaster gets electrocuted and magically turns into the crapiest skeleton dummy in the world had my friends and I laughing for a good ten minutesbr br Bottom line: If youre into watching really horrible movies seek this one out If not run for your life
I bought this out of curiosity How did John Carradine (who died in 1988) and Cameron Mitchell (who died in 1994) make appearances in a film made in 1995? Thanks to the miracle of unused film can footage thats probably been sitting on a shelf somewhere for ten years thats how! You can tell because the film stock used to shoot their scenes doesnt match the film used for shooting Jack-O The curse of Ed Wood lives on The good thing for both Carradine and Mitchell is that this is exactly the kind of movie youd expect to find on both of their filmographies Same goes for Scream Queens Linnea Quigley Brinke Stevens and Dawn Wildsmithbr br The setting is Oakmoor Crossing on Halloween and some kind of curse is released when dumb beer-guzzling teens disrupt a grave The result: a hulking killer with a scythe and a big plastic pumpkin on his head! He (it?) goes after the wholesome Kelly family for revenge (and kills others who get in his way) The father opens a Haunted Garage for the neighborhood kiddies The son (Ryan Latshaw son of the director) has one continuous perplexed facial expression for all his scenes and one hilariously badly acted dramatic scene lying in a grave At least hes a kid The mothers eyes about pop out of her head while she strains to read her dialogue There is also an annoying woman who shows up to explain things who seems to be trying to phonetically pronounce all of her dialoguebr br So what about the name actors? You see Stevens Wildsmith and Mitchell briefly on a TV screen (theyre used to pad out the time) Linnea has a bigger role as a babysitter and she does exactly what she can with it Her enthusiastic performance helps a little bit Theres also one out-of-nowhere laugh when an ultra-conservative couple who watch a Rush Limbaugh clone on TV bite it The woman slips on a rug and stabs a toaster with a knife Shes electrocuted and the end result looks like a flame-broiled Muppetbr br All and all pretty entertaining stuff! I wasnt bored!
I had known Brad Linaweaver at Florida State U in the early 70s when he was an inspiring inventive writer who I thought was headed for greater glorybr br And that is why I rented this video Well well well the time has not been kind to Mr Linaweaver I suppose the pressures of making a living makes higher aspirations expendable Another flower whose bloom has come and gone un-noticed in the summer breeze Amen There is nothing more to say And nothing more to add A sad epitaph to a once blossoming career as stated above But it is the price one pays for chasing shadows without a firm foundation or goals for oneself in life Because this movie has no goal no purpose and I kept telling myself what happened to Brads creativity his once shining genius? Gone gone years of neglect has deteriorated his once shining mind
I felt compelled to write a review after seeing the only review which gave this film a suspiciously high 910 rating I say suspicious because it looks less like a review but more like a publicity statement Perhaps the filmmaker himself or one of his mates has written that review? Naughty naughtybr br I watched this movie on the Propeller channel on Sky TV expecting it to be truly awful The special effects used were to be honest very very good for a low budget film and some of the acting wasnt that bad either but most of the acting was really awful but well done for trying as I expect most were pals of the filmmakerbr br I think the filmmaker has done really well by trying to punch above his weight I did find some of the film funny because it was trying to be super cool when it just wasntbr br If you dont take this film too seriously and watch it whilst drunk with some mates you might well have a good time but probably not in the way it was intended This film is no way a 910 but worth watching for a laugh bearing in mind it was made on a very very low budget and in fairness due credit to those involved in its production
I really did not want to write a harsh review of this movie because I genuinely appreciate how hard it is to make any kind of movie on an incredibly low budget let alone attempt something as ambitious as a sci-fibr br However this movie is truly awful The acting is among some of the worst I have ever had to endure and as a fan of low budget movies that is a pretty serious accusation to make There are plenty of aspiring actors out there who would work on a deferred payment scheme if they believed in the movie and what the director was trying to achieve Im sure the actors did their best as did everybody else involved in this production but it simply was not good enough to pull off something of this magnitudebr br Then there is the dialogue Very poor indeed There is no excuse for that I got the impression the script was hastily written on the back of a beer mat after some epic boozing session I hesitate to use the word laughable but thats exactly what the script is I had no empathy with any of the characters Indeed they grated on me with the result that on more than one occasion I wanted to thump a couple of them Mr Stirton has overstretched himself by taking on too many roles Clint Eastwood he is not Again there are talented people out there willing to work on deferment if they believe in the projectbr br Much has been made of the special effects in this movie For the money they are exceptional if somewhat overused It is like someone said I have after effects and boy am I gonna use it Whoever did the CG work was among the most talented of this crewbr br Quite simply the money was not available to make as ambitious a movie as this attempts to be Kudos for attempting it but unfortunately it fails to reach its heady goals in far too many waysbr br I salute everyone involved with its production I really do but for their next effort they either need to get a better producer or lower their sights to something more manageablebr br In conclusion I cannot recommend this effort to anyone other than the most enthusiastic of film students or habitual insomniacs If you want to watch a true masterpiece of low budget sci-fi films try the student made Dark Star by a certain Mr John Carpenter
I went through great efforts to get this movie after reading the comments on this site I really dont have time to write reviews but I felt this was my duty as a sci-fi horror buff This is only the second review I have written The other was for Dracula 3000 Now to the point This movie sucked Plain and simple I kept wondering if I was watching the same movie as those who wrote all those lovely comments I have seen movies with bad effects bad acting bad sound you name it and Ive seen it But this really sucked I dont care how much it costs or didnt cost to make movies like this and Dracula 3000 should be banned and the whole cast and crew arrested and jailed for time murder By the way Did I mention that this movie sucked I mean really sucked The plot was non exist and the acting was weak It seems like the writer saw Pitch Black and got upset because he didnt think of a plot like that first so he decided to make his own ripped off version But instead the suck factor took over and possessed him DONT WATCH THIS Youll have more fun if you pull down your pants and sit on burning coals
I pride myself in being able to sit through everything I think if Ive paid the rental fee then Im going to at least watch it I have found the exception to this rule- The Planet I dont know what the exchange rate is but reading through the other comments I can only guess that £8000 must be around $150 Ill date myself but this movie reminds me of the old Steve Reeves movies of the 50s He was a bodybuilder turned actor He was in these really awful Italian dubbed movies that starred Reeves as Hercules or some other muscle bound hero As a kid watching them you couldnt quite articulate why these movies stunk- you just knew they did Mike Mitchell IS the new Steve Reeves Thats it thats what this really was- a new telling of an old Italian Spaghetti Sand and Sandals movie And I kid you not- where was Reeves born? Glasgow Montana This movie isnt so bad that its kind of fun to watch- its just plain bad
This movie was awful plain and simple! The animation scenes had absolutely terrible graphics It was VERY clear to see that this film had about the budget of my grocery bill!! The acting was just as bad Ive seen better acting in pornographic films I would seriously like the hour and twenty minutes of my life back In fact I registered on IMDb just so that other people dont get sucked into watching this like I did Dont get me wrong though I love sci-fi films! This one seemed more like the intro to a video game :( Im glad I only spent a dollar to see this one! The story line reminded me of the movie pitch black A prisoner on a ship in outer space escapes Oh my goodness what are we gonna do??? I would not even let this play in the background of my house while I was cleaning! Bottom line here you can do better
Ive got 10 plus year old computer games with better special effects! Plot is choppy and very predictable Most of the actors seem like extras with no experience! Everyone has Scottish accents Its like watching a crew of Scotties from Star Trek without the personality or charm Needless scenes of people putting up tents! Tents with all of the supposedly high tech equipment! Actors looking like they were not sure the camera was on them Nothing to make you care if these people survive or not! Looks like it was made in someones backyard and garage using low end equipment! Nothing seems original or even slightly entertaining Do not waste your time!
I really didnt like this film~!!!! it was boring and didnt interest me that much at all im more of an action girl and it had NONE i went and rented this movie because of the other comment that was left but was totally mislead! dont get this movie unless you like the dessert and plenty of boredom i just really didnt like the movie it wasnt my style but it could be yours you would just have to watch the previews or something but its my recommendation if youre a girl dont get this movie! This Scandinavian production draws on some of the observational strategies of Godfrey Reggios Koyaanisqatsi allowing us to reflect on patterns and phenomena of human and natural existence from both intimate and sweeping viewpoints this just isnt for me!
Even with its low budget this movie could have been worth watching if there was a story to tell here It started out pretty good and fairly engaging and believable The actors and characters were interesting although there wasnt much character development My favorite scene was when they were all eating their rations Some seemed to hate it and some seemed to think it wasnt too bad The story starts out very airtight And then br br And then it dipped into a little horror which is usually a death sentence for most sci fi Suddenly no scientific basis for any of the goings on No real believable end game for the villain? No real explanation of whats going on Generally if a movie has to use the F word for every other word it usually spirals down from there too I still get offended believe it or not I often wonder what inspires people to make bad sci fi? Isnt there a universe of fantastically good stories out there? Dont people feel like they are wasting their time and everyone elses when they put out stuff like this Why do we get so much mediocre sci fi like this? No female actorscharacters either? None at all? This had the makings to be another Predator but alas fell far far short br br My final comment - poor editing and finally too low a budget to build a real campfire? What gives? br br My advice for any low budget sci fi movie production companies out there Make sure you got a good story before you start and edit out bad special effects - its better we see nothing than something that looks fake or ridiculously fuzzy
Going to need to take a deep breath for this onebr br Terrible special effects that tried to reach far beyond the limitations of the budget Blatant and unashamed plagiarism of other sci-fi movies (like Pitch Black) Terrible acting Endless slow motion scenes of characters walking aimlessly across sand dunes Meandering dialogue that does nothing to further the story Characters wearing turtle neck sweaters on a desert planet with two suns A cargo ship staffed by a camouflage-wearing crew of gun-toting soldiers (why exactly would you need forest-camouflage in space anyway?) Some of the worst casting choices in the history of no-budget film-making - a steroid swollen captain who comes across more like a muscle-beach jock than a trustworthy commander and a convict who looks and acts about as dangerous as a bunny rabbit 70 minutes in length 35 of which could have been trimmed out if the director had any concept of compression of time through editingbr br I wont go on Suffice it to say that while some components of this awful movie can (and should) be forgiven due to its low budget; the bad conception laughable plot holes and snore-inducing script are unforgivable on any budget The end result is a tedious dull waste of time Sorry guys I hate to be so harsh on an amateur film but youve no excuse for turning out this kind of work
I was excited about this movie after reading other reviews What a disappointment! There are so many ways that this movie is bad The computer graphics were lacking to say the least I found the acting stiff and unbelievable Watch the sand as the lost e-pods (what an original name!)are found Where did all the tracks come from? I immediately recognized portions similar to other movies ie Alien Pitch Black Come onone huge ship to transport one prisoner? And what is with the prisoner? Does he speak can he speak? I kept waiting for something to tie the bits of the story together but it never came If this movie was made on a low budget it shows The only part of the movie I liked was when it finally ended I dont mean that I liked the ending I didnt I just liked the fact that it was over A trip to the dentist would have been more enjoyable In my opinion dont waste your time on this one
It is OK movie if it would be done by high school kids for their friends It is way below limits be called professional There isnt plot no actors play and visual looks like you see it through the plastic film I was so glad that I have FF button on my remote 32x worked really well I understand that everyone need to start somewhere but it shouldnt be reason to bring it to the public If you have concerns about quality and budget - Open water was made on $60000 and more than half went to the guy who provided the security in the ocean and trained sharks And that movie looks 100 times more professional and it was an event in the indy film-making
This movie is proof you cant just go to a Redbox and read descriptions of films and pick one and give it a trybr br While Ill give em great credit for having produced a film with halfway-decent special effects on such a low budget and at least a halfway decent script and story line unfortunately it was only just that: halfway decentbr br If you like movies where things arent all neatly wrapped up and dont mind low-budget effects you might like this film Honestly it wasnt really my cup of tea I shouldve just gone to bed rather than spend my time watchingbr br For a better science-fiction movie produced on an even LOWER budget (!) have a look at Primer
I think its safe to say that if you only really watch box office standard films or any premium production dont bother with this film as you will hate it If you are an overly critical film buff dont bother either If you love science fiction films and dont care what capacity you get a glimpse of the future in then youll be mildly entertained It is very obvious that the budget for this was super super low but what they have done with the money is worth a pat on the back Some of the burning fire scenes were pretty bad and the evacuation scenes were terrible but it is quite obvious that they had some good support from a computer perspective as the planet scenes and the alien images were quite inventive The dialog is down right hilarious but acting not altogether poor As for the story well Im not too sure what actually happened at all to tell you the truth
I think that you can not imagine how these people really work!! Before I came to the studios to watch the guys work there I actually thought quite the same as you do But since I saw and did the work the guys on that TV-show have to do I have to say that they really do deserve respect for what they are doing all day long That really is no easy work And also the actors which in your eyes may be terribly bad are really great people and a lot of them really can act! I dont think that the material given to them can really show that as I think this material isnt very good But THEY are truly good! So I dont think that you before you havent seen these guys doing there work can judge over them! And I shouldnt have judged over them as well before I met them but I did and am now terribly ashamed of it So please do not allow yourself to judge over these great people unless you havent seen them doing there job
I watched this movie only because I was under the impression that I was going to be treated to a cheesy horror flick I mean look at the tag line: Theyre men turned inside out! And worse theyre still alive! Does that not scream cheesy horror movie to you? And the then theres the title itself-- Screamers What a perfectly apt title for a horror movie I thought! Unfortunately I wasnt aware that the real title was properly translated The Island of the Fishmenbr br So about an hour into watching this I realized that this was not a cheesy horror movie at all-- it was a cheesy adventure story about slimy fish-men from Atlantis Men turned inside out? No There was nothing of the sort I was grossly disappointedbr br Damn you misleading taglines! I want those 81 minutes of my life back!
OK by the time you read this I MIGHT have stopped crying This movie was so horrible as to be quite vexing The creatures are kinda cute but the only really good thing about the movie was the growing attachment among the prisoners and their guard after getting marooned on this daffy island Even seeing Barbara Bach with her hair all riffled was no payoff for buying this sterling bit of poop She goes about with a whispery Ive-never-used-my-voice-before breathiness that just dont wash when one is screaming bloody murder (Hey the leading man was cute too but Im still not assuaged) This is a cry-into-your-beer ripoff of the good ole Island of Dr Moreau Poor Richard Johnson who was surely born for better things is just unrelievedly bad as the bad guy I mean HOW bad can a BAD guy BE? (Ask Richard Johnson) Joseph Cotten tries hard not to look embarrassed as he staggers through his cameo appearance In the name of all thats holy dont rent this darned bomb
Yes the video cover of this movie made me want to watch this film as a child It was called Screamers on this particular cover with the tagline Men turned inside out! It even featured this warped looking skeleton on the cover as well that made all sorts of cool gory images run through my mind Perhaps some sort of movie about some strange virus that caused a persons flesh to burn off maybe a movie about undead zombies that are more bloody looking than what you usually get a science experiment gone incredibly wrong and now strange men with the flesh dripping off their bones go on the rampage Yes all these thoughts ran through my mind one that did not was fish guys on some island with virtually no gore and all bore This movie is really more like the Island of Dr Moreau than anything else and quite frankly that movie bored me too it is way to much scientist and not enough killing for my tastes These films are to much figure stuff out and not enough blood for my tastes Yes I know I have strange tastes but I can not help it I like my horror movies either really bloody or fast moving and exciting this movie is really neither
Its exactly what the title tells youan island inhabited by fishmen Shipwrecked doctor Claudio Cassinelli and crew land on the island theyre either picked off by the fishmen or roped into working for treasure hunting lunatic Richard Johnson Cassinelli discovers that Johnson who believes hes found the lost city of Atlantis has been keeping disgraced scientist Joseph Cotten and his daughter Barbara Bach hostage for 15 years so the fishmen can uncover a treasure trove beneath the sea Cotten of course is a complete madman Bach and Cassinelli have great chemistry This insanity was directed by Sergio Martino and is not surprisingly without merit Its fast paced reasonably well acted and the fishmen look pretty convincing (though its unlikely anyone could prove that these things DONT look like actual fishmen) Theres an excellent music score by Luciano Michelini
I saw this movie as part of a Billy Graham program The church I attend was part of a community wide outreach to present God and Christianity to our community (Hartford Ct USA) I was one of the counselors who helped attendees (who were invited to come forward and make whatever kind of religious profession they wantedand to follow up on them after the movie As such it did what it was supposed to do and I personally found it to be a medium to strengthen my faith in GodI also found it to be very helpful to those I counseled I especially like the work of Kim Darby in this movie And the parents (the Wintons?) were  in a way a little overdrawnno one says to their child if they think that he or she may be the parent of an illegitimate child something like the Wintons did oh no no not thaaat That isnt exactly what they said but the sympaathetic audience I saw had a laugh at whatever it was they did say and also at the sons emphatic No MOm not me Don Berghuis
This version is very painful to watch All of the acting is very stilted but especially that of Norma Shearer who is still acting as though she were in a silent movie instead of a talkie Check out the 1937 version with Joan Crawford Robert Montgomery and William Powell which is much more entertaining
I found this early talkie difficult to watch and Im a Norma Shearer fan! Its not her fault but the primitive production values of this film would cause any viewer to become bored 90% of the movie is filmed with medium shots and its very similar to watching a dull play
Youd hardly know that a year later MGM put Norma Shearer in THE DIVORCEE which glows with MGM technical know how How far they came in one year CHENEY is a very stagey early talkie The camera hardly moves Shearer is her usual charming self and Rathbone does well in a romantic leading role They are all very careful to speak clearly and slowly into the microphone source which does mitigate against a naturally flowing dramatic scene but the play is a sturdy and fun warhorse so one can enjoy oneself if ones expectations are not too high Oh by the way the plot involves a ring of upper class jewel thieves who infiltrate themselves into society to prey on their victims There are some clever twists in the script and true love conquers all An Oscar nom for Best Screenplay Adaptation
As a physicist talk about blackholes and cosmology gets my heart racing However I found this presentation too slow and not packed with enough information for the interested layman (who is most likely to see it) If you have more than a passing curiosity in this sort of stuff go to the library and check out some books You will find they explain current scientific cosmologies with far more detail while at the same time filling you with more of a sense of wonder than this movie does Also to set the record straight: Hawking is NOT considered the greatest mind or the worlds smartest person as commonly asserted even among the user reviews here at the IMDb Hawking himself has commented that It is rubbish It is just media hype They needed somebody to fill the role model of disabled genius At least Im disabled To be fair he is probably a genius but among historys greatest scientists people like Einstein Newton Gauss and many others easily are even more highly regarded This is not to disrespect Hawking who is a undoubtedly a great scientist but rather not to disrespect others who have done even more than he has Anyhow see the movie if you are truly into science But if not I think it would be boring for you
Clifton Webb is one of my favorites However Mister Scoutmaster is not one of his best His patented curmudgeon role seems forced and even unpleasant rather than funny The film itself is overflowing with mawkish sentimentality In addition the viewer is presented with numerous ham-handed references to religious faith and US patriotism that come off as over-reverent rather than genuine Clifton Webb does his best with a poor script Edmund Gwenn plays yet another jovial clergyman and is given nothing to do The child actor lead is played by a talentless child who displays a flat affect throughout the entire film His sole claim to fame as a performer evidently is a bullfrog-like low voice unusual for someone of his age However once youve heard it youve heard it and you dont need to hear it again Unfortunately he is in the majority of the films scenes I find this child so irritating that I fast forward whenever he shows up Since he has a lot of scenes in this film this means that I fast forward through a lot of the film There were and are so many talented child actors; its a pity this film doesnt have any of them in it Still Clifton Webb in the traditional broad-brimmed hat and shorts is a sight worth seeing
I just watched this movie on Bravo! and it was absolutely horrible It has the plot of a Shannon Tweed movie without the nudity The premise was interesting enough a winning lottery ticket in a secluded area and people who have reasons why they want the money The characters were trite as were the observations on human nature and greedbr br For a movie called Class Warfare it had very little to do with class differences other than the first 20 minutes and the predictable ending This movie could have done a lot better if there had been more characters with motivations to get the ticket and was a who done it?br br The acting wasnt fantastic but its hard to seem believable with such a terrible script Lindsey McKeon is very cute and Id like to see what she could do in a better production with a better script Shes probably the only reason why I sat through the whole moviebr br 
Despite the fact that this was a Made-For-TV movie (and an obvious one at that: ie cheap looking) CLASS WARFARE left me wishing I could get my money back and considering this lame production was partially funded through Canadian dollars I might just be entitledbr br What made me sit through it in the first place was seeing actress Lindsey McKeon who Ive watched for the last couple years in her role as goody-goody Mara Lewis on the soap-opera GUIDING LIGHT taking a turn at playing the bad girl for a change br br Surprisingly she does quite well as Kristen a spoiled rich-btch who suddenly finds herself dirt-poor but with a conniving streak and a twist of fate that will possibly change her fortunes back around The twist of fate is provided in the character of Richard (Robin Dunne) a socially-radical outcast who discovers that he has just gone from having nothing to winning $23 million on a lottery ticket Now put Richard Kristen her jock-boyfriend Jason (Wade Carpenter) and their camcorder-obsessed mutual buddy Graham (Dave McGowan) together for the weekend in a remote cabin cut off from the world by storms and just guess what unfoldsbr br The film suffers from congesting both the story and characterspersonas and motives too much Everyone is pretty one-dimensional and it doesnt take a rocket-scientist to figure out that some things and some people are going to go very bad very quickly I dont think this is that original a plot and it doesnt go out of its way to make itself anything more The acting is OK McKeon is spot-on as the manipulative female lead and Dunne is very good perhaps a little too good at times but no one else is worth writing home about The only other real credit I can give the film is the one twist I didnt see coming towards the end (not the very end though that one is so obvious it hurts) Regardless I sat through all of it and lived to tell the tale so I cant say it was a complete write-off br br 410 A something-to-watch-when-nothing-else-is-on type movie
The Man with the Golden Arm (the movie) is a decent career vehicle for Frank Sinatra but fails abysmally as a good adaptation of a fantastic book You always hear about how books are changed when they are made into films- things are cut out dumbed down etc Well you cant even say they changed anything with the movie- they just told a completely different story The characters and setting are the same sure- but not the ambiguous characterization the depth of the men and women of Polish Chicago in the book As for the setting its become merely a play stage complete with the unnecessary supporting role players walking all too busilly down the claustrophobic interior exterior streets The movie is a dumbed-down completely different take on Frankie Machine and drug addiction When this happens Zosh Frankie Sparrow all lose their psychological edge Frankies drumming a modest dream in the book becomes his full passion in the movie (probably because Sinatra is a musician) And drug addiction is treated as shlock exploitavely The acting is decent especially the snakelike Louie who is more menacing in the movie than the book But its just a shame this kind of movie can be heralded as a classic alongside the book it is based upon the real story of Frankie Machine The movie just goes to show Hollywood can get anything right without dumbing it down and adding a happy ending In this case they just changed it completely cheapening an important and realistic story into Hollywood fluff Im sure as hell biased because I read the book first so I cant really treat the movie honestly by knowing how good the book is I actually thought about turning the movie off (and I never do that) just so I wouldnt get its silly plot confused with the beauty of the book But this is an overrated film and while its not so bad the book should come first as it was the first And it should have remained the only story of Division Street and Frankie Machine
This is the story of a maniac cop who for some reason has it in for a young college stud and his mates After they report him to his supervisor who in turns suspends him pending psychiatric evaluation he finds an opportunity to psychology torture them when on a bet the kids hack into a department stores security and unlock the door Only they get locked in the store along with the weirdo Murder and mayhem are afoot and the kids are running around trying to survive until morning when they may be able to escapebr br Dangerous Game would have been a successful cat-and-mouse psycho thriller probably if it was set in a different location The thought of psychotic cop chasing around a bunch of innocent teenagers in a department store just didnt work Especially when he comes face-to-face with his flinching prey quite frequently and yet does nothing serious quite often There was no real confrontation as would be sufficient for this kind of story and mayve worked better if say for example the teens were loose in the neighborhood and left to fend for themselves against this weirdo (especially if that took a few days while he makes them increasingly paranoidalthough granted even that is clichéd)br br What a shame too that it could not have been a better thriller considering a funky cast of young Australian characters Even a light hearted adventure despite the madness of the villain interspersed through the picture might have even made it a more satisfying picture Instead it started out fresh and sure did have plenty of action sequences but wound up verging on the ridiculous
I have NEVER fallen asleep whilst watching a movie beforebr br I did with this onebr br Avoid at all costs give your time and money to a worthy cause instead
If B movies tired and corny scripts and golf carts dressed up as some sort of futuristic mode of transport are your sort of entertainment youll probably enjoy this Otherwise forget it The topless newsreader though completely irrelevant did give a few seconds of amusement
Planet Earth has suffered a terrible environmental disaster so humanity now survives underground split in to different religious cults  What caused the catastrophe ? I have no idea ? why is humanity split in to different ecclesiastical factions ? I have no idea  Since the surface of the Earth can no longer support human life how are the humans able to grow crops in order to feed the population ? I have no idea  What sort of producer thought this screenplay deserved to receive funding ? I have no idea br br SHEPHERD is one of these films that creeps up late at night on cable channels  The sort of film where you consult the IMBb to see if it has any merits  The number of people whove commentated on SHEPHERD on this page hasnt yet reached double figures and this is a film that was released nine years ago  Perhaps the people who have never seen it are the lucky ones ? br br As for the rest of the plot its very routine  Grumpy former cop Boris Dakota whose wife and child died several years previously meets a woman and her child and its up to him to save their lives  almost like a futuristic western  Throw in a former wrestler who now runs the God channel  a fascist Christian bloke whos trying to snuff out Boris  a ventriloquist  some T&A for the sake of it and youve got a mess of a film  I guess after seeing this Neil Marshalls DOOMSDAY is possibly a masterwork of cinema in comparison
First of all let me start by saying that I have been a devoted follower of C Thomas Howells career ever since The Outsiders and The Hitcher He was an up and coming star in the 1980s - with hits such as Soul Man also The future was bright for this young actor and he had the potential to go on from there and really assert himself in Hollywood Put it this way - Tom Cruise had a bit part in The Outsiders while Howell had the lead Look at Cruise today !!! But picking material like this drivel will only denigrate Howells career even more - if that was possible Why does he pick stuff like this? A small part in a major movie would be of more benefit to him than this rubbishbr br Essentially the story here takes place in a post-apocalyptic world where everybody lives underground where chaos reigns Howell is a Shepherd - protecting the flock of various religious leaders by killing off any undesirables Hes a hit-man in other wordsbr br The sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a Thunderbirds episode The use of slow-motion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting (and bad is a kind word here) no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a Corn Flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity Oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic toobr br I hate writing bad reviews about films - especially those in which I really like the star - but this film is so bad I dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it I am not a filmmaker nor am I a director but I would hide my head in the sand if Id spent whatever amount of money and time on this moviebr br In short - this was a monumental waste of time and energy and I would not recommend anyone to EVER see this film It came free with a DVD player I bought but I still turned the thing off halfway through because I was embarrassed for Howell Come on C - give yourself some credit and wrestle yourself away from these non-hit wonders and try to knuckle down and get a good part - however smallbr br 110 - and only because there is no setting for 010
I say flick because this doesnt deserve the appellation movie and certainly not film I regret paying for the rental and although Ive never walked out on a movie before this would have been it had I seen it in a theatre A society living underground in the future (oooh THATS original) lots of burning barrel drums unexplained ambient light shining through windows an ungrateful woman and her shock-muted sonthe list goes on and on C Thomas Howell affects the husky voice of the stereotypical loner; you know like Eastwoods been done to death He needs special sunglasses to remember his wife and child yet in the flashbacks hes the same age! Talk about a poor memory! I stared incredulously when the little boy Abe randomly pushes a code into a door and it opens! No tension pithy religious (what religion?) underovertonessaddest of all: I expected better from Roddy Piper;br br Quite possibly the worst movie experience in my life
Okay now this movie is a piece of work Its full of stupid jesus refrences and dialougue that would render most human biengs to question whether or not they should be wattching movies at all Big names like Roddy Piper and David Carradine draw you in but take it from me this movie sucks The story is incomprehensible and lacking completley in intellegence The sets veihicles and costumes come of as a cross beetween bablon five and a bondage flick Im sure theres porn with better dialougue
I am so disappointed After waiting for 3 years for repeatsthe DVD of the original masterpiece series Darkplace i couldnt wait for this series The first episode just ended and I am appalled Everything that was great about Darkplace has been erased here pretty much Worst introduction: canned laughter this takes the original point of it away and just renders it nearly unwatchable (one joke about Garths eyes fertilizing the audience was good the rest i can hardly remember) it feels like a poor quality Knowing Me Knowing You I hope this improves as the series goes on otherwise i shall be seriously disappointed back to Darkplacebr br You are the most compassionate man I ever known And i know God
Some spoilers A Soap has some wonderful moments to recommend it When Charlotte and Veronica get close to intimacy is a beautiful low key truly erotic scene I also loved the music score and the soft muted cinematography Im not clear if the curious stop and start structure of the film comes from it being digested originally in serialized form (the announcer describing the action in sections is quite annoying) My biggest problem with this film is its rather absurd depiction of a transwomen and her life Of course she has to be shown as a sexworker (what else) scatterbrained impractical absurdly frillygirly completely hopeless when it comes to dressing and incapable of making any interpersonal attachments in the world Moreover shes always shown with two days growth of beard (for some bizarre reason) as if to emphasize how tawdry her life is And shes waiting to get gender reassignment surgery when she seemingly has done nothing else to forward her transitioning In truth the character resembles a drag queen not someone in the midst of transitioningbr br These are typical fantasies of people from the outside who really arent connected to transpeople The films fetishization of GRS surgery is a way of objectifying people who are going through transition Not impressed with this aspect of the film in the least At the very least why not have the character played by someone who really is transgender I thought the male actor portraying Veronica was okay but no better than that Much better was the woman portraying Charlotte a very complex character full of energy self-loathing desire and contradictions If she was so fascinated by someone with female energy a Charlotte could go out to a womens bar in two seconds and find it Yes she was drawn to Veronica but more as an abstract idea of someone with malefemale characteristics (a gentle touch but with a good punch) not as a unique person Yes what A Soap says about love is often lovely and moving but that doesnt mean an already stereotyped minority has to be stereotyped some more in the processbr br This film also proves that Danes are lousy dancers For such a promising premise (better executed in a film like Different For Girls) the final film is a letdown
I know that Trey Parker and Matt Stone really hate celebrities and spoof them in every single episode of South Park (if not showing them then mentioning them) and they love to mock and joke and make fun of themselves too but I felt this mockumentary went too farbr br For one thing the most common running theme in the documentary is that theyre episodes are meaningless pieces of crap they put out just for the money Obviously thats completely untrue if you even bother to watch any episode and the constant You know I learned something todays said at the end of almost every episode by the main characters The creators are also depicted as pompous arrogant asses who only care about money including a supposed-to-be-funny-but-isnt scene involving Isaac Hayes delivering lines for Chef (over the phone) and Trey Parker yelling and screaming at him for sucking and hanging up I guess its supposed to be funny but the pretension in it just really made it cringebr br The way they interview employees working for Trey and Matt shows the duo as tyrants who push their employees to the limit all just for money in the end Completely untrue obviously and all a joke but its just not funny Its disturbing even though its just a joke
If you take the films Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome and the movie Steel Dawn with Patrick Swayze you will have a pretty good idea what the film is about The only problems is that the film lacks the production values of either and represent mainly cheap copy of the former two True the film has plenty of action but asks the viewer to suspend belief No one can shoot a 50 Caliber Machine gun by holding it in his hand - and miss everything to boot nor can you shoot at a group of people with an automatic weapon and miss the whole bunch There is also a problem with poor editing when the school bus flips over it is easy enough to see the cannon used to do the job And the lady driving the truck through it is superfluous since she had more than enough time to stop the truck If you are interested only in mindless action and violence then the movie is easy enough to watch But dont expect anything on paar with Thunderdome or even the somewhat cheap and tacky Steel Dawn
As other reviewers have noted this movie is a cross between (ie stolen from) stories we have seen before Specifically this looks like Clint Eastwood in High Plains Drifter inserted into Mad Max Remove Clints cigar and replace with a cigarette; remove his horse and give him a high-tech motorcycle and voilà an updated drifter In this movie the hero is even more blatantly a Savior than High Plains Drifter Now our hero has long brown hair suffers a wound to his left side and his entry into town is preceded by a plea for salvation by the surviving townspeople--a pretty transparent reference to a Second Coming I watched the movie on a hot humid morning Sleep was impossible and upon arising at 4:30 am there was nothing else on TV So the movie served its purpose While unoriginal with characters that are almost comic caricatures the movie is still somewhat entertainingat least at 4:30 in the morning
I made it about 8 minutes into Steel Frontier before I turned it off Then glutton for punishment that I am I watched some more the next day Today I had to iron a pile of clothes so I decided to finish the movie and that was its own punishment Heres what I dont understand: Robert Rodriguez and Shane Carruth each spent $7000 on their debut features and created two remarkable movies Yet here we have two directors with arguably way more money and they churn out a huge steaming pile of crap Let me see if I can figure out the logic: Its Road Warrior but its like a future Western Well get the cheapest actors we can find well have my mentally challenged cousin write the script and well spend the budget on a bunch of explosions We cant lose!br br Seriously I dont think even the MST3K guys could improve this But if you insist on watching it I recommend getting very drunk first
I just finished watching Dog Watch I thought parts of the movie were hokey with more than a few implausibilities The acting wasnt too bad and the plot wasnt bad BUT as the saying goes the devil was in the detailsbr br Some examples:br br 1) The bleed-through on Charlie Falons (Sam Elliott) bandage was shown to be coming from the back of his hand while it was his knuckles that were bleedingbr br 2) Would a detective dispose of his murder victim from a very well-lighted area? This seemed very silly to mebr br I am not unusually picky about a movie but in my humble opinion this one is definitely NOT recommended by me
Although the story is good and portrayals what I expected of Sam Elliot my DVD copy contained almost unbearable synchronization problems The dialogue was almost 3 seconds behind the lip movement throughout the whole filmbr br I would therefore be very careful in purchasing any DVD of the film without checking for the problembr br I would also follow the recommended censors classifications particularly in relation to language and drug usagebr br This film could become a silent classic cop movie and with the above cautionary notes I can recommend it to prospective viewers
This time The Beastmaster(Marc Singer) returns only to face off a new enemy Arklon(Wings Hauser) however due to an annoying teenager(Kari Wuher) they are transported to the future where they then duke it out Lots of (lame) fish out of water jokes ensue You honestly dont get sequels this rotten to the core Beastmaster 2 is a painful movie to behold The references and hipness date the film badly (This was made in 1991) and really who wants to see The Beastmaster in the present times? Also of note is Wings Hauser whos embarrassing performance is easily the films best asset Singer looks awkward Wuher is irritating and the whole 1991 slang just makes the movie downright unwatchable This is easily one of the worst movies ever madebr br 12 out of 4-(Awful)
This is the greatest example I can think of to prove the theory that when Hollywood runs out of good ideas they make an awful sequel and ruin the first one Now dont get me wrong I absolutely love the first Beastmaster; I even liked the third one pretty good but this movie is atrocious I am a huge fantasysword & sorcery movie fan and I hated to see such a terrible sequel made to such a classic as the first Beastmaster So why do I hate this movie so much? Well where do I begin? First of all the whole idea of the movie is ridiculous Dar and his evil older brother Arklon(who was nowhere mentioned in the first movieHuh?) cross over into our world via a handy dimensional time-portal gate Ya see Earth just happens to be on the same parallel interdimentional plane as Dars world Whereas with the first movie youre led to think the movie just takes place in the past but with this one youre shown its a completely whole other world altogetherthats just one of the many things I hated about this sequel It didnt work with Masters of the Universe and it sure doesnt work here either! Movies like this should take place and stay in their own time-line and their usual surroundings For Christs sake whats next? Hercules in New Yorker uhbad example! Moving onbr br Arklons after a device called a neutron detonator to use as a threat against his enemies to rule his own kingdom So its up to Dar his ferretshis eagleand his tiger(not a spray-painted one this time) to go off and save the worldbut along the way they have the help of a young cool and hip Senators daughter who gets caught up in this whole mess and she shows Dar around LA takes him for a joyride in her BMW and helps get him out of tight situations here and there How convenient right? And speaking of convenient I found it awfully convenient and easy for Arklon to sneak into a highly guarded military base and get away with a stolen highly destructive nuclear weaponeven with half the US Army and LAPD after himwaaaaay to easy even for an evil barbarian sorcerer from another world There are sooo many plot holes in this I dont know where to begin; like why did Arklon go to the LA zoo for at the end of the movie?!? He absolutely has no reason whatsoever to go there; and wouldnt that be like the last place youd lure your greatest enemy who just so happens to have the handy ability TO CONTROL ANIMALS?br br And dont you just love these kinds of movies where the police are portrayed as total idiots and even with half a dozen cops firing at one guy they still dont manage to hit him? The police in this movie belong in the Police Academy series! They are about as useful in this movie as reading glasses are for the blind! Even the title of the movie makes no sense: Beastmaster 2 : Through the Portal of Timethey never actually went through a time portal because the movie isnt set in the future of Dars world its set in a parallel world along ours in the astral plane so they NEVER actually go through time only a dimensional world along theirs; so NO actual time-travel is involved at all! This movie tries to come off as funny and it doesnot because of the humor but because its just so badand thats putting it mildly The acting dialogue plot characters and ending are all so cheesy its hilarious What more can I expect from the guy that brought us Return of the Swampthing(another bad sequel)? Sorely missed here is Don Coscarellis wonderful directing and serious feel of the first one!! Avoid this stinking piece of garbage like the bubonic plague and stick which the first one and maybe the third one if theres nothing better on TV
Truly flatulent script and I was very disappointed with Marc Singer for agreeing to be in itbr br I actually walked out of the theater about 15-20 minutes into it and demanded my money back I have actually walked out of a movie only 3 times in my life (I am 43 years old) and this is the only one that made me mad enough to demand my ticket price back If I could have I would have gotten a refund on the popcorn too This was a truly lousy movie and there is no excusebr br For one thing how does someone who was raised as a pre-tech barbarian learn to DRIVE A CAR? IN California!!!? (Driving a car is a somewhat tricky skill and in California even trickerI should know I live there)
I love the first and third Beastmasters but this one was an abomination It was almost as horrible as The Never Ending Story 3 for the same reasons They took a fascinating fantasy world of Barbarian tribes farming villages witches supernatural creatures and a cult of religious fanatics using a pyramid; and thought it would be funny to mix in our materialistic pop-culture world of rock & roll sushi (I think thats what it was) and flashy sports cars These two worlds do not belong together I do not want to see a bunch of ancient barbarian looking people dancing to some rock song on the car radio I have a sense of humor but this is just stupid This is what Hollywood does to good fantasy movies when they run out of ideas Dont give up though the Eye of Braxus is much much better That one I gave a 10 This one Portal of Time I give a 1 Believe me I dont always give such extremely high or low ratings I just tend to comment only such movies
If you are ever in the mood for a truly terrible film it would be hard to find something that could even compare to this I have spent a lot of time watching a lot of terrible movies just for the sheer joy I get from it and man this is one of the worst This movie was so bad I had to buy the third Beastermaster online That one wasnt as bad which is amazing since it was straight to video This is one of those films that is hard to comprehend how it was made in the first place I mean someone had to actually have read the script (or many scripts Im sure they made several drafts) and said Yeah thats it Heres some money Actually they probably just wanted to make a Beastmaster 2 before they even had a script then went with whatever they had Ack horrible So if you are a fan of really bad movies watch this one It is a true classic and film doesnt get much worse than this And if it does please let me know
This one kind of is like an earlier movie from 1987 Masters of the Universe based on the cartoon He-man Basically you have a great old world and they for some reason have to have nearly all the action of the movie take place on modern earth Well I guess it is not so modern earth now and that it is an ancient world now of strangeness and a den of good times gone by Well I guess I can figure why they did in fact place nearly all the movie in modern times in this and that movie To save money on costumes and sets It is a lot easier to recreate what is going on in the present than a strange world like that of Eternia in He-man or an ancient world with cults and strange pyramids sacrifices and strange creatures that hug you to death This movie is forgettable and not very entertaining your first clue that it is not going to be the best movie in the world is that Robert ZDar is in it The only thing this one has going for it is the animals which are not as prevalent in this one as they were in the last Marc Singer is back and it is sad to seem him in this state the guy was a fairly good actor reduced to trying to make a sequel to a movie that really did not need one and even if it did it came five years to late
Mr Bean is just a bunch of unfunny slapstick humour It is the most shallow humour TV series ever made in history The scenes are often disgusting and the horrible canned laughter sends chills through the spine Mr bean is a selfish and rude character and one can only sympathies how pathetic he is It is incredible that such a TV series of low quality can be sustained for 5 years It is a complete waste of time to watch even 1 episode and one cant help but to express disgust and pity why Rowen had portrayed himself as such a 2-dimensional unfunny and ridiculous character Or pity yourself why you had even bother to watch an episode Watching this is an aggravating experience
Starts off with Fulci playing a version of himself writing down some ideas for how people could die Followed by a fake-looking cat eating what is presumably a brain The copy I watched was dubbed in English which I always hate but I was particularly disappointed not to get to hear Fulci in his own voicebr br Fulci is in a sort of feverish state working on his latest horror movie His stomach turns when he sees things that resemble effects from his movie and he starts to hallucinate that he is witnessing acts of horror He visits a psychiatrist who hypnotizes him and unfortunately he does not have his improved mental health in mind I was reminded of the psychiatrist played by David Cronenberg in Clive Barkers Nightbreed (1990) The shrink in this one is played by David L Thompson who is pretty bad Probably a real life friend of Fulcis he has a big toothy grin when he kills people though this may be Fulcis black humor at work which I thought was pretty poor toobr br The movie is composed of a lot of clips from Fulcis movies either as if Fulci is on the set directing them watching recordings on TVs or witnessing the acts Ive never been too much of a fan of clip shows in TV series and I also think things like Charles Bands Full Moon Entertainment cutting their old films down and putting three such cuts together as new anthologies are pretty lame I guess they need to make money?br br The shrink in Cat in the Brain makes reference to the theory that violence in movies begets violence in real life One of Fulcis co-workers talks about having a documentary crew follow Fulci to see what his life is like Lots of self-referential stuff like thisbr br In the end some of the characters sail away on a boat named Perversion
What do you do with all the material that does not make the final edit of a film? You might keep it aside in case a directors cut or extended version is released one day You might sell some it as stock footage to be used in a part of another film You might just bin it Or you might collect it accumulating more and more from each film you make and then use it to make another film disregarding coherence or any sense Throw a very primitive skeleton of a narrative into it and line up a number opportunities (nay excuses) to slot in your celluloid cast-offs Excuse the abjectly nonsensical nature of the plot by framing it all in the mind of a horror film director and youve got yourself an awful film This can all be done with just a few days shooting And idiots like me will waste two hours of their life watching it And then come on here and try to warn others away The whole chain of events is one big waste of time
Dr Lucio Fulci (Lucio Fulci) is a director of gory horror movies who is starting to feel the effect of having filmed too many bloody scenes He visits his local psychiatrist to see if he is losing his marbles; this proves to be a bad idea since the shrink is actually a crazy murderer responsible for a spate of grisly killings Seizing the opportunity to make Fulci his fall guy the loopy nut doctor hypnotises the horror hack into thinking that he is responsible for the recent series of murdersbr br On the surface Cat in the Brain appears to be a fantastically gory treat from spaghetti-splatter god Lucio Fulci Chock full of chainsaw dismemberment axe attacks and various other bloody killings the film certainly spills enough claret for even the most hardened gore-hounds But when one looks closer it turns out that many of the gruesome scenes are lifted from earlier movies (mostly Fulcis own masterpieces); remove these from the equation and one is left with a nifty basic plot idea that is totally wasted some welcome nudity and dreadful performances from Fulci himself and David L Thompson as the psycho shrinkbr br As the film progresses it develops into an incomprehensible mess with the borrowed gore footage inserted randomly with no attempt at working it convincingly into the story If youve seen Fulcis Touch of Death and Ghosts of Sodom or Mario Bianchis the Murder Secret then youve already seen the best bits of Cat In The Brain beforebr br After much bloodletting the film wraps itself up rather quickly leaving the viewer feeling bewildered and somewhat cheated Watch the film if youre a Fulci completist but I would suggest seeking out the films from which the good bits were taken
Out of 15 people I loaned this movie too NO One finished it It was so Awfully???????? Not good Just awful She sits in a chair the whole movie Shes in a Closet The Chair shes sitting is nice I cant think of anything more to say But 10 lines of text To print this up My friend Nick thinks this is a great movie because he can give it to his friends and not have to worry about THOSE calling him back Hes passed it around as a gag movie for 10 years Which is how I got it Then I tried to get my friends to finish this extremitys awful awful piece of crap To no aval no one could finish it Takes boredom to a whole new level They could use this in Iraq INSTEAD OF WATER BOARDING PLEASE SEND COPIES Guantanamo BAY CUBA Makes great Xmas gift
I classify this as the worst movie of all timebr br If there ever was a movie I would wish upon my enemies this would be it The plot is ridiculous there are only 2 characters and the coincidences between these characters just completely strain beliefbr br These factors combined to make this an extremely boring moviebr br My wife and mother walked out on the movie about 15 minutes in I figured that a movie this boring and slow must have some cool interesting plot twist and a was quite disappointed when nothing exciting materializedbr br I briefly considered sending the filmmakers a bill for my 2 hours of lost life
This is possibly the hands down worst movie every made that actually took itself seriously And not as a result of the acting because being an actor I have to say that Rickman and Stowe had to be at their best just to escape needing electro convulsive therapy after the principle photography wrapped Being one of the 57 people that actually saw this movie in theatrical release I have to say I have never before or since experienced a movie where the movie ended credits rolled the house lights went on and no one moved from their seats About five minutes after the house lights went up people started coming out of their comas to look around and I think most of us thought okay we get it that was a joke right? they are going to show the real movie now Eventually after the ushers handed out disguises and we swore an oath of secrecy to never admit we were there we felt that it was safe to leave praying that we would not be seen leaving the auditorium I have seen some pretty bad movies in my day (I have Cinemax for goodness sakes) but I am still bitter that I will never ever be able to recover those two or so hours of my life that I lost watching Closet Land
Closet Land is a nasty piece of work with superb actors Nothing more (or less) happens in the movie besides the unending abuse of an attractive woman prisoner by a sadistic police official The setting is minimalist This might be considered soft core S&M porn because the drama is devoid of all reference points such as time place and political context Since what happens is cut adrift in a fantasy futuristic environment the abuse becomes purely personal The pornographic aspects are justified by being a warning about the evils of totalitarian government but because there is no real context for the torture of this young woman we come away disturbed but having learned nothingbr br What is the point? That torture exists in the world? That abusing prisoners is bad? That dictatorships abuse innocent people? We know that already Closet Land has echoes of such works as Darkness At Noon and Ionescos Rhinoceros but both those works were made by competent artists whose work had historical context and depth of meaning This work is amateurish and the dialogue sophomoric A definite thumbs down
This movie includes 2 well known actors I have previously enjoyed watching There actions are great and each action is heart felt But it makes me think these 2 were thrown into a speechdrama class at college for the first time and told for one to act dominating and constricting to the other in a room without allowing her to leave and the woman to be truly innocent and treat her with enough mind-humping to drive the audience into tears for her releasebr br The only good part IS the acting abilities the plot has the same ruse as Hitlers influence and I started to hate the protagonist for that But all of this could have been done within 15 minutes in my opinion so to drag it out for over an hour was just pure punishment for all who watched itbr br 
The best scene of The People Across The Lake is the genuinely creepy nightly opening-scene featuring a house a murder & a lake After that its pretty much downhill from there on as far as the horror is concerned A family (mom dad sister & younger brother) is fed up with the (mildly) dangerous environment of suburbia and decides to go and live near the titular lake From then on the film features too much lame happy family-related doo-doo near the lake with occasionally some corpses popping up here and there The couple of scenes where they discover the bodies are pretty convincing (in terms of creepiness) but they are in shrill contrast with the rest of the goings-on (featuring just every-day-life stuff of the family settling in) The truth to the matters (the mystery as to whos doing the killing) is learned too soon leaving only the family unknowing and the viewer yawning during the unexciting finale (featuring a discovery in a basement and running around the house) like if this made-for-TV thing suddenly remembered it was supposed to be a horror film Its not really badly made; the content & story is just not interesting enough The only highlight in the cast is Barry Corbin though his performancecharacter is just a bit too goofy to be taken serious Blond cutie Tammy Lauren (the daughter) might be a recognisable face for avid horror junkies too as she also starred in Wishmaster (1997) and made-for-TV outings like I Saw What You Did (1988) & The Stepford Children (1987) She hasnt got much to do in this film though Skippable but watchable if anything
Its been over 30 years now but I still remember that this movie was the worst Ive ever seen I would have thought that in this length of time something worse would have been filmed but I was mistaken I just finished watching STARSHIP TROOPERS and it came mighty close but it was still more entertaining than  POOR COW 
Now I loved Lethal Weapon and Kiss Kiss Bang Bang but I cannot believe Shane Black wrote this pileor that David Morse and John C McGinley are in it I screened it for a film festival Awful Everyone was laughing Its preachy and heavy handednot to mention stupid Also its surprising how little LA looks like Cambodia The entire idea of time traveling through post-traumatic stress disorder is kinda dumb Imagine Born on the Fourth of July mixed with The Butterfly Effect 2 (I used to sequel as the example to really show how bad this movie is) but directed by Michael Bays 2nd unit director That bad The 2 stars are purely based on the production value
i have one word: focusbr br wellbr br IMDb wants me to use at least ten lines of text okay lets discuss the fine points of focus i dont know about the rest of you but in my first year of film school they taught us a lot of useless crap like youll all be famous avant-garde filmmakers someday--but they also taught us how to do this crazy thing called FOCUSING the lens! it was amazing! you give a little twist and wham! everything is clear as a bell the person who shot what alice found needs to learn a few things about the finer points of focus lighting too this movie is not only completely out of focus its also lit like the corner of someones basementbr br dont even get me started on pacing or plot they could have trimmed about ten seconds off the beginning and end of every single shotbr br but who cares about that anyhow? there is not enough lurid in this movie to make up for the utter lack of regard to films best friends--FOCUS and LIGHTINGbr br words to the wise
Really average is the only word that comes to my mind when you see thisbr br The acting was average (maybe a bit above average) the camera usage was average (actually below average The picture was so shaky and the colors were grainy and blurry) The plot was a good one but moved at such a slow pace and wasnt put to good usebr br This couldve been so much more if it didnt go at a snail pace and we saw more into the characters backgroundsbr br All we see are flashbacks here and there of Alice and how her home life is so bad (her mother is a working class woman trying to make end meet for her and her daughter) We see a flashback of her of when she was in high school and her friend says to her tell your Mom to make some better food and everybody says its your mom Yeah thats embarrassing but why would you run away from it br br I could definitely see if her Mom was a drunk or somebody was abusing her but nothing was wrongwith her home except she was embarrassed by it How immature! br br Were not even given a glimpse of what the couples lives have been like (except that theyve been prostituting for awhile and the woman forgot her name gave her baby up when it was 9 months old) This really couldve been so much more It couldve had Alice who was abused by her drunk mom go down to Florida with her friend but then becomes a prostitute Or something along the lines of that other then the real plot of this movie (that is) Alice a girl with a home life of probably 90% of Americas population (WORKING CLASS) runaways to Florida but then gets sidetracked by turning into a prostitutebr br I dont see why it won an award at Sundance (it mustve been up against some really weak competition to have won that one award) br br Also to me Alices BostonNew England accent seemed forced It didnt seem genuine (I should know I was born and raised in Boston but now live in Georgia) br br 410 Not really worth your time in my opinion
This is one of those movies I watched and wondered why did I watch it? What did I find so interesting about it? Being a truck driver myself I didnt find it very realistic No Ive never used a lot lizard nor have I ever seen nor heard about one traveling around the country in a brand new seventy thousand dollar RV eitherbr br Same thing about a pimp whom has never sampled the lady in question (until the end of the movie and well he still really didnt) and only getting 50 bucks a cut when the prostitute gets $20000 (well $15000 after his cut yeah)br br I still laugh at the lot lizard comment Ivey made (thems Lot Lizards theyll screw anything with 20 bucks and some are men dressed as woman or something equally as weird) meaning were better then them as we may still be prostitutes but we get paid BETTERbr br Other then that its just a story of a young woman whom wanted something more from life then a dead end job while living at home (shes 18 remember?) and embarrassed by her mother basically doing the same thing (dead end job) At least she had a roof over her head and a job She turned FIVE tricks on the road I wonder if the $75000 she made was worth it? Id guess not
Kazuo Komizu who hasnt made one decent film directed this notorious shocker and should be ashamed that it was a hit upon its Japanese releasebr br Yes it does feature scenes of rape gore and dismemberment but so what? It has the style of a bad American porn film shot and badly photographed by Ed Powers (Dirty Debutantes) and is incredibly slowbr br It seems to have earned its notoriety based on its roster of anti-social actsbr br There is a huge difference between this and horror that is well producedbr br Just because someone likes their cinema a little wet does not mean theyll accept crap like this On the contrary that kind of fan (myself for example) tolerates even less crap than the average punter out there because hes seen so much and has become overly discerning Its a shame production companies dont realize thatbr br One reviewer here (ZombieKilla81) commented that the films near obsession with gang rape is one of the factors that killed it I disagree The subject matter is never the issue The issue is how that subject matter is treated In ENTRAILS OF A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN it is treated so unimaginatively that it is boringbr br Personally I like graphic depictions of psychopathic behavior (with an intriguing context) if the material is well directed freshly photographed and aesthetically pleasing This Nikkatsu horrorpink hybrid is woeful
This program was shown in an early morning time slot on SPACE a cable sci-fi station I am amazed that anyone would pay for this or broadcast it; it is incredibly amateurishbr br The entire show is a sequence of short monologues or scenes performed on a set that looks like a closet with a bunch of circuit boards taped to the wall There is very little continuity between scenes and no plot A typical scene revolves around some lame joke or special effect and is only a minute or so long The dialog makes little sense and the special effects look like Photoshop filters The actors are all adults but I have literally seen high-school plays with better writing and sets This program is an embarrassmentbr br Perhaps each scene would work as an interstitial; a filler between shows instead of commercials Stringing all the scenes together makes the limitations of the material extremely obvious
The opening of MORTE A VENEZIA resembles a Duran Duran music video with classical music and this is the highlight of the movie br br  In terms of what Theo ?  br br In terms of everything  but especially excitement  I doubt if theres ever been a more sluggish slower moving movie than this one  Yeah okay its a European art house movie so I wasnt expecting Charles Bronson to massacre hordes of bad guys but even so I did expect some substance if not an actual plot br br The film revolves around Professor Gustav Von Aschenbach visiting Venice  Gustav visits Venice and goes on a gondola  Gustav eats in an expensive restaurant  Gustav looks out of his hotel window and if its excitement you want Gustav has a flashback br br Bad enough if this was the entire movie but it gets worse because Gustav notices a pretty boy teenager  So youve got a middle aged academic lusting after some teenage boy he has seen  some old queen is becoming obsessed with a stranger  Great idea for a movie ? I dont think so either and thank gawd it remained a yawn fest instead of some sleazy precursor to gay porn br br I notice a lot of people who praise this movie have tried to intellectualise it  I can only be monosyllabic and unpretentious in my view and say that the only subtext I could relate to was the physical and emotional disintegration of Gustav but it wasnt caused by the effete beauty of the teenage boy - It was caused by watching such a boring and ostentatious movie
I was entertained to see that some of the reviews here were topped with SPOILERS the joke in my family is that the only part of this movie that isnt given away on the back of the box is given away in the title Perhaps I am just a dense American 17-year-old who wouldnt know art if it bit me in the leg but I prefer movies that have at least some words This movie makes the second half of 2001: A Space Odyssey down right chatty This movie is just so slow it isnt even art it is merely boring We follow this creepy guy who is following this boy around Venice The end was incomprehensible until I read the end of book A movie shouldnt make you refer back to the book it should be able to stand alone This movie has no way to stand It doesnt even have the bones of a plot to lean on
This Movie Is Horrible!!!!!! You wont believe this hunk of junk is even a movie!!!! Critters4 was better then this!!! And Critters4 was pretty frigging bad too!!! A bunch of stupid teens crash in a desert find an old run down bungalow and end up fending off horrifically badly stop motion animated spiders Pardon my french but the acting was bad as hell!!! The person who wrote this probably didnt even know what a spider is because he had the spiders living in a colony serving an alien-queen-ripoff queen spider! SPIDERS DO NOT LIVE IN COLONIES!!!!!!!!! THIS MOVIE IS A PIECE OF CRUD!!! At the end the marines suddenly pop out of no where and kill all the spider without even being called!!!! If you see a copy of this movie at a video store douse it in gasoline and throw a match at it!!!!
My wife and I watched this after DVRing it off of Encore action this past week It has to be the worst horror flick either of us had ever seen Predictable dialogue ( my wife and I were guessing the lines before they were spoken) hokey special effects a screenplay that drifted all over the place I think the part that was the most annoying was the stereotyping of the various characters in the plot not to mention the gratuitous sex scene between two of the young heroines in the movie neither of which had any real purpose other than to bare certain parts of their anatomy for the cameras This movie should be categorized as comedy not horror as the villains of the movie (spiders) were stop motion animated and not believable in the least I cant say that I would have done a better job making a film myself but it was very amateurish and wasnt even a B movie somewhere closer to a d movie or f if that is possible I think even Science Fiction 3000 would have to pass on this one!
I usually love these movies Give me a good old B movie any day but this one was simply awful The acting(?) was terrible almost to the point of my turning the movie off completely I thought I saw the all time worst but this one is right up there with Attack of the Killer Tomatoes! In all honesty - it was the acting that did this film in for mebr br I found the actors to be clumsy and the lead malefemale were extremely dull This movie had absolutely nothing going for it I may be asking a ridiculous question here but why the nudity and sex scene? Did the producers think nobody would watch if they left them out? I think they were probably right! Oh where is Price and The Tingler when you need them?
This is one of those movies that you watch because its bad Such a movie that you watch just to see its shitty craftsmanship Supposedly a horror I cannot imagine how anyone can be afraid of a claymation bug especially one that is translucent in nature where you can see the actors legs behind itbr br Even with no budget a little bit of attention to detail and even an attempt at making this movie believable would have sucked the fun right out of it as they would have had to replace all of the actors and the entire story with it If I had nothing to make fun of while it was playing I would have stopped it after 10 minutes and put on some quality show like Spunge Bob Square Pants (HAR HAR HAR)br br I Strongly recommend that Brett Piper get with Quintin Terrantino and Really pump out some fecesbr br :)
I watched this movie based on the comments of a few that said that is was bad but funny But you need to be warned that this movie has the worst special effects ever produced They make 1950s science fiction movies look like works of art This is funny at times but annoying for the most part And to compound the problem with the seriously pathetic special effects is the total lack of logic that characterized a majority of the events depicted One of my favorites is where three of the characters drop hundreds of feet into a tunnel created by the arachnia and arrive to find it fully lit Apparantely the arachnia have also managed to hook into the power grid Very impressive But this is just one example And for what its worth the music sucks the acting sucks the two cute girls are annoying the obnoxious guy is annoying the so-called handsome lead man is a geek and the black girl who fall for him is a fool Her father is the worst actor I have ever seen I am not sure the brief moments of humor can possibly make up for the experience
36100 This is not to be confused with the decent Arachnophobia this film is a very low budget and cheap rip-off of that movie This one is so bad it actually does have some entertainment value on that level There are numerous unintended (I think) laugh out loud scenes I wasnt expecting much from the film and it was actually worse than I had imagined it would bebr br Its a cliché ridden and predictable direct to video mess Fortunately it doesnt take itself too seriously The acting as expected is not quite Oscar caliber The special effects are poor worse than I would have thought they would be Poorly edited and the score is intrusive
I picked this up because having spent time in the Albany region of New York I knew a couple of people in the movie and I happened upon it by chance The attempts at comedy are lame the compulsory girl-on-girl scene is sickening the plot is nonexistent the acting is among the worst Ive ever seen and dont even get me started on special effects I realize this is a very low budget film made by a small independent company but if youre going to do a sci-fi horror flick with giant bugs dont make the giant bugs completely unbelievable People want to see giant bugs Thats half the fun right there And if youre going to make the giant bugs completely unbelievable at least get the actors to make some sort of tongue-in-cheek allusion to that fact (You idiots! These arent them! Youve captured their stunt doubles!) Be prepared to waste two hours of your life that youll never be able to get back
In a way you have to respect Arachnia Its clearly meant as a tribute to the big bug movies of the fifties and while the special effects look terrible; at least the film doesnt feature CGI However on the other hand; you cant respect the film too much because its a load of rubbish The acting is terrible the special effects (as mentioned) are impossible to take seriously and once youve seen one giant spider being blown up; youve seen them all so it gets boring rather quickly The plot follows a bunch of people who are unlucky enough to be in a plane crash after a meteor shower They go to the only house in the area; which just happens to be a house where a man has a huge spider he used to use as a circus attraction Coincidently around the same time the meteor shower has caused more giant spiders to rise from underground All the characters in this film are poor caricatures; none of them have anything even resembling a third dimension and they will soon begin to thoroughly bore you Youve got to feel for director Brett Piper as he clearly didnt have much to work with for this film; but that doesnt make Arachnia worth a damn and overall there are better giant bug films than this and therefore Arachnia doesnt get the seal of approval from me
Angels and Demons: 3 out of 10: Clearly something bad has happened to Ron Howard I dont know what exactly but something has gone very wrongbr br Howard has always been a decent workman director While he will never be mistaken for an artistic savant both Cinderella Man and Apollo 13 were excellent films Parenthood was pretty good and even Angels and Demons prequelsequel The Da Vinci Code was a fun romp In addition none of his films have been downright awful (Note I have seen neither How the Grinch Stole Christmas nor his newest film Heidi Montag Says No to Plastic) Whats more Howard managed to hold this quality is such devise genres as star driven Oscar bait (A Beautiful Mind) star driven costume drama (Far and Away) star driven revenge fantasy (Ransom) and comedies about prostitution and mermaids (Night Shift Splash)br br Angels and Demons is at its center a poorly directed and shot film Scenes are too dark camera angles are all wrong the actors block each others shots and the whole affair is often out of focus This makes the telling of an already confusing story even more muddledbr br Dan Brown gets picked on a lot but I found The Da Vinci Code a fun readable romp (so sue me) The movie version of the Da Vinci code kept the same where are they going to next vibe of the book and added an attractive cast and attractive location shootingbr br Angels and Demons however takes place in the claustrophobic confines of Vatican City and since Howard wasnt allowed to film in many of the real locations we end up with a lot of running around a CGI back lot The entire film is as if Rick Steves did a Vatican City special and instead of actually visiting the Holy City and pointing his camera Rick had to use Lego bricks and a second hand art book with all the tits erasedbr br While the Da Vinci code had what I still think is an intriguing central mystery (again sue me) Demons and Angels story consists of a plot by the Illuminati (roll eyes now) to destroy the Vatican Their idea was to take positions in schools for the deaf around the world and raping every student in the ass repeatedly Oops my bad; apparently the Vatican doesnt need any help on that onebr br Anyway their plan is to infiltrate Europes Large Hadron Collider kill the head priest and steal three vials of Anti-matter This begs more than a few questions Can the Hadron Collider create anti-matter? Can you capture the anti-matter once created? Why is the EU collecting it? (Perhaps they fear a Godzilla attack?) Why is the head of Anti-matter gathering a Vatican priest? Now once they get the anti-matter they are going to use its incredible destructive power to take over the world no just kidding; unfortunately the Illuminati havent quite grasped that Pinky and the Brain level of sophistication just yet Instead the current pope has just died and its conclave time The top seeded cardinals for the final four pope tournament are all kidnapped and the Illuminati are killing them one by one Seven style They being good sports however are leaving clues at every murder like some Latin themed Riddler Oh and the last kidnapped Cardinal has the anti-matter and if he isnt found in time Rick Steves will have to go straight to Venice next year to see decent frescoes If only there was some Latin themed Batman to save the day? Okay the story is truly awful and it is poorly told but maybe this is one of those films saved by great performances A true character study (Okay you know where this is going) Tom Hanks gives an incredibly wooden performance and simply looks awful (he is also to old to play the character by about twenty years ) his love interest Israeli actress Ayelet Zurer has zero chemistry with either Hanks or the screen Ewan Macgregor plays the Popes personal assistantcabana boy as an Irish man who looks like he is about to break into a musical number at any moment providing no one steals his Lucky Charmsbr br On the plus side Stellan Skarsgård puts in a fine turn as head of Vatican Security and as far as we know no deaf children were raped during the making of this film which puts it ahead of its Vatican critics in at least one area
I had neither read any of the books nor seen the first movie so after receiving passes to a preview show I had no expectationsbr br Angels and Demons was a muddled convoluted film lacking direction or any believability There was very little character development and I never found myself caring about the plight of the protagonists; the reverse was true I was more interested in seeing how the antagonists would succeed as the first half of the film was almost exclusively focused on why the Illuminati are who they arebr br The film jumps from location to location with little explanation or reason and expects the viewer to believe that everybody in the movie is an ally when they first meet Any analytical mind will realize this is highly improbablebr br The climax is extremely cliché and leaves you asking what happened and wondering why nobody considered some of these points it feels very tacked on and unnecessarybr br The actors are not particularly believable in their roles mostly because I found it difficult to believe that scientists professors and men of the church would act in the manner that they do without regard to the consequences of their actions Events that happen are not plausible in the slightest and the pace of the movie is questionable with the characters jumping around while on a tight schedule and I had to question how the protagonists manage to get from location to location on time every timebr br The most pleasing part of the film is the cinematography I found it a beautiful film to watch but it was such a mess that I found it would not be worth paying to view in theatres
This critique tells the story of 4 little friends who went to watch Angels and Demons the movie on the first night it came out even though it was a school night because Angels and Demons is worth it Two of the four had read the book Of those that didnt a guy was wearing pink skinny jeans This was the least eventful part of the evening after watching the abhorrent Angels and Demonsbr br The movie starts out in a lab where the antimatter is being created while another process is going on And apparently someone knows about it or something Notice how very confused I am I dont get what happened: they were just making the antimatter Vittoria finds her own father dead WHAT? The Illuminati symbol sent to Langdon is a PRINTOUT not a burn on someones chest They take out the X-33 scene They take out Maxmillian Kohler They pretty much take out CERN and the symbology connected to it They take out the Hassasin and replace him with some religious British dude They take out the Illuminati Diamond They take out Vittorias near-rape scene They take out Langonds fight with the Hassasin (now British dude on crack) They take out the press dude following them around They take out the death of the fourth cardinal They take out the fact that the Camerlengo becomes pope They take out the Camerlengos grand scheme They take out Langdons being in the helicopter and landing on that island toward the end They take out the fact that Vittorias father was a scientific priest They take out Langdons fun and most unfortunately they take out Vittorias sexual appealbr br Other than the movie COMPLETELY losing focus of the details the movie is acted HORRIBLY One must admit though there were some good things For example the Sistine Chapel recreation must have been extremely difficult and it was extremely well done The explosion scene was MIND-BLOWING Other than that SCREW THIS MOVIE FOR RUINING THE BOOK FOR THE PEOPLE WHO DIDNT READ IT
An EXTREMELY fast pacedexhilarating interesting detail rich book Its a huge shame that the film had none of these qualities not only was Tom Hanks mild mannered portrayal or Robert Langdon Laughable but the name changes to key characters huge deviances from the original story line and poor IrishItalian accent from Carmalengo Played by Ewan Mcgregor made for the worst book to film EVERbr br As a huge fan of A&D the book i had high hopes for a more lavish true to book detailed movie where it would start and finish just as the book did - leaving me wanting morebr br All the film really did was depress me within the 1st 10 minutesbr br what was impressive was how the sorry! i couldnt even finish that sentence without laughingbr br in short - Vittoria was the token hottie a very second to Audrey Tatou and there were some very nice Alfa Romeosbr br i would recommend reading the book to understand that if Ron Howard must insist on making ANOTHER book to film i would be happy saving my £640 for a KFC zinger meal and some chicken wings - far more entertaining and deeply more satisfying!
I went into the movie expecting a little action mixed with a strong story line I understand that changes between written works and movies must be madefor many reasonsbr br The changing of the relationship between the scientists ( they were father - daughter in the book) The Director of CERN was eliminated thus causing the scene between the Carmelengo and the Director to be changed to the Carmelengo and the head of the Swiss Guard in the Popes officebr br Ron Howard made sure to get his dad inserted as a Cardinal with a hayseed accent but missed all the symbolism Both Lagdon and the Carmelengo ascended to the heavens in the helicopter with Hanks character landing in the river and the priest landing upon the chapel in what was described as a Christ-like imagebr br At some point this film needs to be remade by a director who is up to the job
Recension: Angels & Demonsbr br The movie is directed by Ron Howard He has had also made famous movies like The Da Vinci Code & Cinderella Men He directed also the famous TV-series 24 The most famous actors are Tom Hanks(The Da Vinci CodeThe Green Mile Forrest Gump) & Ewan McGregor(Cassandras Dream Moulin Rouge Star Wars: The Phantom Menace)br br In the begin I was shocked because they changed the beginning from the movie so big Because they changed the father of Vittoria Vettra(Ayelet Zurer) in someone else Silvano Bentivoglio(Camren Argenziano) Another Change is that Robert Langdon(Tom Hanks) never goes to the CERN It was nice that they could film on location in the CERNbr br Then movie goes on They are spectacular car races in Rome An I also like the part in Chirstian Archives very much when they destroy the work of Galileo it was funny It was also funny that they where locked in the archives the second time they get in Robert Langdon destroyed half of the archives and when they bust out the electricity get onbr br I found It very stupid that Robert Langdon not went in the helicopter but that the Camerlengo(Ewan McGregor) gets in alone another detail is that in the movie the Camerlengo is an adopted son from the pope In the book He is the real Son of the popebr br When I should give the best acting performance then I should say Pierfrancesco Favino who plays inspector Olivetti The worst acting was from the assassin who was played by Nikolaj Lie Kaas I think he was underachieving because in Adams Apples he played Faboulousbr br I think the whole movie is underachieving because director Ron Howard made some many stupid changes I would rate the movie by 410
Im a historian This movie is so wrong it hurts Tried to watch with an open mind but if youre going to delve into a movie or anything for that matter of this nature at least do some homework regarding history locations church protocol et cetera Stop playing to the dumb audience please There are those of us out there that actually put on our shoes and venture out to the theatre when something of this nature worthy of a theatrical release comes to town A little research all Im asking But then again the book its based on is somewhat of a joke in itself So basically they took a novel with many errors and decided to make it into a screenplay pour millions and millions and millions of dollars into it and make an incredibly promoted world distributed theatrical release and at no time have anyone take the time to do a little research on the lot of it I know several of my colleagues who would have done it for just the credit alone or at least given it to a body of students as an assignment for several weeks to research various aspects or just pay someone knowledgeable a couple of bucks just to run through it because trust me there are plenty of starving historians out there who would have jumped on the opportunity if it had presented itself
Firstly I loved the book more so than the more popular Da Vinci Code and although the DVC film was not well received I liked it and bought the DVD However there is no chance that I will ever want to watch Angles and Demons ever againbr br The film barely resembles the book in fact only the general premise of the story is therebr br From the very start of the film I was disappointed in the book Robert Langdon receives a call and fax from Maximilian Kohler Director of CERN Who finds the body of Father (cant remember the name) and then requests Langdon to come using the super fast plane In the book the only people who knew about this technology that the Father and Daughter team had created were themselves and the camerlingo In the film however there was a massive team involved so the tension was never there how did they find out etcbr br Leaving out or rather changing this whole part of the story was a massive mistake and was in my mind what made it a poor movie it changed everything that happened from then on when the Camerlingo was confronted in the popes locked room it should have been Maximilian Kohler who shot the video from his wheel chair the commander rushed in to get the camerlingo but was shot by Olivetti in the film it was the commander in the room and Olivetti was shot (err I think I got this right but I was bored and cant really remember the events in the film)br br There was no love interest between Vittoria and Robert and in the book she wasnt at CERN when he arrived and was indeed was flown in from her research work In the book all four of the preferratti were killed but in the film the last one of the four survived the fountain In the book Vittoria was kidnapped and Robert had to rescue her and it was they that killed the Assassin at the Church of the Illuminati not blown up like he was in the film by the Camerlingo The bit where Robert was confined under a stone coffin was not there saved by his Mickey mouse watch alarm OK in the book we are led to believe that Langdon bailed out of the helicopter fair enough to say that this was a bit far stretched but it was important in the film because he had to race back with the film There was no mention of how Vittoria and her adopted father became involved this was also important in getting to know the character of Vittoriabr br In all one of the worse films I have seen I would have left early but my brain went numb and I lost the use of my legs temporarily A really really reeeeeeaaaaaaalllly poor attempt and not one of Ron Howards finest in fact how he will get work again is beyond me!!! I want my money back!!!
Ron Howard and his editors only had one job to do Follow the guidelines of the book which was rich mysterious moving and highly cinematic in its approach! br br What they did? They changed EVERYTHING and I mean EVERYTHING! What is left is something that has no right being called Angels & Daemons! br br I really love the book and find it very hard to see it being treated this way!br br I wonder what was the opinion of Dan Brown himself for this filmbr br I really have no patience to sit down and right the 1000000 changes they made it is pointless
The implausibility of the plot has been noted by several commentators particularly the immense amount of trouble Fr McKenna would have had to have gone to and the sheer impossibility of some of the calculations he would have had to have made including that Langdon was going to decipher each clue in minutes McKenna is branded; a few seconds later he is giving orders and a few minutes later he is running (literally) around in charge of operations -- in real life he would be in shock And as usual in thrillers the assassin doesnt kill the heroes giving as his only lame explanation that they were not on the list of those to be killed as though every other innocent bystander he shot was I have always used Independence Day as the hallmark of a truly awful film (US President commandeers jet plane and beats off aliens ha ha) and this effort runs it close For such an implausible film Angels and Demons contains a remarkable number of predictable incidents Who didnt laugh knowingly when the assassin went to get his reward in the Volkswagen? I felt like shouting You are going to be blown up Who didnt know that the heroine was going to find a body in the lab? Who didnt spot the baddie? Technically also the film was awful The dialogue was more often indecipherable than clear while the races across Rome to the next church were accompanied by deafening music Moreover many scenes looked like mud The one redeeming feature was the shots of Rome and what looked like the Vatican -- an achievement because I am sure that the Vatican officials would not have wanted this dross shot in and around St Peters -- and the interiors were convincing Rome is a magic place and I enjoyed seeing it fleetingly
Why did they not follow the book  I am really sad and disappointed I was so looking forward to seeing this movie however if you have read the book (maybe recently) it might be very difficult to remain objective My wife had not read the book and she loved the moviebr br Reasons for the disappointment are: 1) Cerns involvement  gone with the wind such a shame there is a very small part at the start where the antimatter is created but even that does not stick to the facts (why not the fact that Vittorias father was burned with the first Illuminati brand which is how Langdon got involved would have been a perfect start to the Movie_ 2) Story-line between the (deceased) pope and Camerlegno completely gone  this completely screws up the motive for the stealing of the antimatter 3) Story-line between Langdon and Vittoria Vetra completely non-existentbr br All-in-all too flaky storyline and cannot understand that Dan Brown allowed them to put his name against it Maybe I should revisit this film in 10 years time when I cannot remember the excellent book anymore (fat chance on forgetting the book I am afraid)br br Really sorry for the negative review which was spoilt by expectations
I went to see this movie tonight trying to keep an open mind I had hoped to enjoy a movie that I expected to be different from the book There were considerable differences from the book much like the changes made in the DiVinci Code I went to see the DiVinci Code with the same thought process and managed to enjoy the film in spite of the changes from the book It was still enjoyable filled with action and the process of deciphering the symbols was interesting and mentally stimulating Unfortunately Angels and Demons disappointed on almost every level Throughout the movie symbols are found and figured out quickly without any interest for the viewer They blow past the various Immuminati symbols so quickly that we had no chance to get a look at them and appreciate how they work The final Illuminati symbol which was the most interesting and creative one in the book was replaced with the crossed keys symbol In my opinion that was a missed opportunity to focus on and spend a little more time on the symbols which is what the Langdon character is all about Overall this movie is a very poor interpretation of the book and fails at the attempt to be an action movie  thriller 4 out of 10
Personally the book was a very well written amazing thrilling piece that was not brought to justice to the movie Watching the movie at 1201 in the morning to see that major parts of the book were left out frustrated me seeing that it affected the different outcome of the movie There was something to be desired out of this movie but all in all it lacked in plotbr br For someone who has NOT read the book I could see how this movie would be seen as inviting and entertaining with its controversy and suspense However to a dedicated reader who has read it seven times I did not see the strong connection between the two: both the movie and the novelbr br With major characters missing (such as Maximilian Kohler) and the abrupt turn in plot with the survival of the last cardinal in the preferiti the plot of the movie was slightly strewn thus leading to a different take in the conclusion of the story The Hassassin too was portrayed as a common white man compared to that of in the novel where he was portrayed as a Muslim; his motives in the book are predominately based his ties with the Illuminati however in the movie his motives are based on money and seemed more like work than some personal tie to the task at hand
It is difficult to imagine how the engaging Dan Brown novel Angels and Demons could misfire as badly as this film version Here are ten reasons why the film was a failure Due to the spoilers please do no read on unless you have already seen the filmbr br (1) In the film there was no love relationship between Robert Langdon and Vittoria Vetra Worse still there was not even any chemistry between the two leading actors br br (2) The breathtaking locations in Rome as described in the novel were not realized visually in the film I am aware that director Ron Howard encountered difficulties in filming on location But there are superior photographed depictions of Rome on The History Channel than in this film where the Eternal City was presented in eternal stock film footage The great art works described in the novel were only briefly depicted in the film The magnificent Bernini sculpture of the Ecstasy of St Teresa was only momentarily glimpsed and the West Ponente relief in Vatican Square was not visible at allbr br (3) The most tasteless choice made by the film-maker was in the depiction of the deceased pope who actually resembled the beloved John Paul II In the novel the pope is clearly fictional with no resemblance to any real popebr br (4) One of the most colorful (and important) characters of the novel Maximilian Kohler Director of CERN was cut out of the screenplaybr br (5) There were numerous instances when the lines of dialog were inaudible due to extraneous background noisebr br (6) There were moments when the faces of characters were not visible due to the shadows and chiaroscuro film lighting This technique worked in The Godfather films but Ron Howard is no Gordon Willisbr br (7) The College of Cardinals was quite a motley crew with one of the electors speaking in a Southern drawl This dude would have been more at home on a Texas ranch than in the Sistine Chapelbr br (8) The crucial relationship of the Camerlengo and the deceased Pope was not defined in the film This relationship was central to the theme of science vs religion and the relevance of the Illuminati to the plot against the churchbr br (9) In the novel the character of Hassassin was an unforgettable villain In the film that assassin characters role was a cardboard cutout villain br br (10) As a whole the filmmakers did not trust the workings of the successful novelbr br In the novel Langdon makes an impossible fall out of the sky and into the Tiber River In Ron Howards film it was the movie itself that landed in the Tiber
Im not in favor of death penalties but in this movie it couldnt happen fast enough Just to end the movie I dont understand why this movie is rated as high as it is It fooled me into a bad night
I think I would probably not hate this movie if I spoke Polish I selected the English version at the first menu but it gave me Polish dialogue with English subtitles just as the Polish version did Maybe the dialogue was so disjointed because the person that did the subtitles could not translate it into English very well To exacerbate the issue some of the dialogue had no subtitles at all The acting was pretty bad especially the female lead who was melodramatic about everything! One scene that bothered me was when a German woman was caught stealing and as the mob was jostling her around her shirt opened and the director showed close-ups of her naked breast for the next 15-20 seconds I couldnt see how her breast added to the drama of the scene or the film Maybe the director was trying to increase the numbers of teenage boys in the audience Much of the film takes place in an extermination camp liberated by the Americans First the American uniforms did not look anything like US Army uniforms Second none of the extermination camps in Poland were liberated by the Americans I would think that a Polish film director who turned 19 in 1945 would know better than an American born in 1966 that all six extermination camps were liberated by the Russians All in all its just not a very good film if you dont speak Polish
THE EXPERT starring Jeff Speakman is the definition of DULL!!!br br Dull characters dull situations dull direction dull actors dull cinematography dull musicbr br I dont really understand this movie Is it supposed to be an action movie? Its almost as if Speakman wanted to be in a serious movie but the level of acting and writing found in THE EXPERT is below your average TV drama And there are some typical Speakman pummeling bad guys scenes here and there but the main aspect of the movie relies on some sort of believable drama which is totally wrong for Speakman or is so badly directed that it just doesnt work with the action star In the end this confused movie looks and feels very nondescript and bland The worst aspect of THE EXPERT is the music The composer is a Jerry Goldsmith wannabe with his pompous and melodramatic score which simply doesnt belong in this kind of (dull) movie Its as if the producers knew they had a very dull product on their hands and they asked the composer to make the film feel more compelling and dramatic with his score which makes the entire movie look even more confused goofier and dullbr br Dont waste your time watching this even if youre a Jeff Speakman fan
Oh well I thought it should be a good action but it was not Although Jeff Speakman stars there is nothing to watchOnly two fight for almost 15 hours yakA lot of talking and everything is so artificial that you could not believe it The plot is clear from the beginning If you want good action dont rent this movie
Jeff Speakman never really made it beyond the lowest ranks of martial-artists-turned-actors (lower than Don The Dragon Wilson for example) and with vehicles like The Expert you can see why There are three major problems with this movie: 1) The plot - or should I say plots - are all over the place there are some characters who get a lot of screen time but serve little purpose 2) There are only 4 fight scenes in total some of them completely unrelated to the main plot and some taking place in the dark 3) The music score is overzealous and overbearing Strange as it may seem this is really the most annoying thing about this film: the score persistently tries to convince you that youre watching some sort of grand epic instead of the low-budget limited-action film you are indeed watching With all that said at least theres James Brolin around to lend a touch of credibility 12 out of 4
An American Werewolf in London had some funny parts but this one isnt so good The computer werewolves are just awful: the perspective is all off its like seeing them through a distorting mirror The writers step on the throat of many of their gags American boy says to Parisian girl Is there a cafe around here? Instead of just leaving it at that they have to have the girl sigh and respond This is Paris
This film probably would have been goodif they didnt use CGI (computer generated imagery)for the werewolf scenesIt made the creatures look fake and the werewolves looked cartoonishCGI is great for certain effects like the dinasours in Jurassic Park or TwisterBut when we see a film where the creature must look completely realCGI is not the way to goLook at An American Werewolf in LondonNo CGIJust makeup and a mechanical creature and what you come up with was more realistic than what was shown in the sequelThis film did offer a few gags that was fun to watch and the humor in this movie seemed to have drawn me in but its nothing more than a film that I thought was OKAnd thats not good enoughIn my opinionAn American Werewolf in Paris doesnt hold up to the original
An American Werewolf in Paris wasnt really that good compared to the originalThe original didnt use computer effects for the werewolf and they looked more realistic The werewolf effects in this film looked too cartoonishmost of allthe movie did not have enough for me for a horror film to enjoy
There is really but one thing to say about this sorry movie It should never have been made The first one one of my favourites An American Werewolf in London is a great movie with a good plot good actors and good FX But this one? It stinks to heaven with a cry of helplessnessbr br 
This is a title in search of a movie Its a pitch that sounded lucrative to some studio executive and the rest be damned When this film was made there were still two things that CGI did not do at all well: people and fur Furry people were thus not destined to look good when rendered by computer This is the only example I can think of where effects for a well-funded sequel took a giant leap back landing well behind those of the original movie For the record the design of the werewolves doesnt help a bit The film-makers apparently couldnt decide between quadruped and biped tried to do both and wound up with a creature that looks equally awkward either way The transformations are anatomically nonsensical and the end result with a relatively high forehead and short snout looks like a cross between Ron Perlman and a hyena But back to the crass part This is a movie which exists PURELY to cash in on its forebear I am not a fan of Landis original film but boy does it look good in light of this If you thought some of Landis humor was forced try some of the excruciating attempts here The bubble gum scene the corpse humor the dog thatyou know youll just have to watch that bit yourselves Thomas Everett Scott is on vacation in Europe with friends and decides to take a break from acting the ugly American and bungee jump off the Eifel Tower in the middle of the night This leads to him rescuing a young woman (Delpy - Julie its not worth this just to become a star in America Ask Rutger Hauer) from jumping to her death She turns out to be part of a cult of werewolves who are plotting toIm not sure something bad Ghastly French stereotypes gaping plot-holes a muddled ending No matter the studio cared only that the title would likely fool millions of American Werewolf in London fans into handing over their cash For the most part happy to say they were wrong
you will likely be sorely disappointed by this sequel thats not a sequelAWIL is a classicbut this movie is about as far from being a classic as you can getwhat a jokespecial effects that arent very specialhorrible dialoguenon actingand a laughably ridiculous subplot quickly and unconvincingly(not to mention fleeting)tacked on with about a third of the movie leftdid i mention the story is less then lametheres no way this was supposed to be serious horror movieyet its to stupid to be funny in any good waythe rating it currently has(4810)is too generous if you ask memy rating for An American Werewolf in Paris:a 3510
Hello peoplebr br I cannot believe that Shades from That Thing You Do took this role I dont think Cory Feldman would have taken this role This movie was a fuming pile of dung Save your money and time and see every one of the top 250 I swear I wanted to slap the lady at Blockbuster silly for permitting me to rent this Stay away!!!!!!br br Mr Hipp
One of two movies I have actually thought about asking for money to stay until the end Most movies have at least one thing that is worth staying for even if it just to laugh at how bad it is I never found it for this movie Nothing was good from the script to the very bad effects The worst movie I have ever seen
I just dont get it Why call this a sequel to the film American Werewolf when it has absolutely NO connection with it whatsoever? The first film was funny and scary with ground breaking special effects (If memory serves the Oscar category for special make-up effects was created for this movie) Paris is none of these things Awful effects and not much else Do not see this movie Rent the original Werewolf in London instead Youll be much happier
Take an utterly stupid story Couple it with unprofessional performances 2 bit graphics add ultra-lame comedy bits and you get this film I thought the original was bad but at least that story was simple and straightforward though idiotic May nobody produce another in this series
AWiP tries to be funny scary tense and romantic  and fails in every respect The acting is average at best but mostly stupid The special effects are not enough to make up for the stupid plot devices and the chemistry between ANY character is juvenilebr br If you dont want to be mad at yourself dont pay money to see it
I had been wanting to see An American Werewolf in Paris for a long time because I loved its predecessor but this film didnt impress me as much as An American Werewolf in London Actually to be quite honest it didnt impress me at allbr br Tom Everett-Scott and his dude pals are wandering Paris and in a preposterous bungee stunt off the Eifel Tower rescuing wolf-babe Julie Delpy from death Before youve time to work out if the constant mugging and lumpy dialogue is meant to be the stuff of comedy a full-moon has hit and the brats are being chased by dreadful CGI werewolves down Parisian sewersbr br The script is disgustingly poor the actors were made to make this film theyre horrible performances match the status of the movie From start to end this movie is never entertaining engaging or even slightly watchable I had trouble watching this whole film without throwing up my dinner to be quite honestbr br The action scenes arent exciting the jokes arent funny and the werewolves arent scary In short: Miss out or be haunted foreverbr br I rate An American Werewolf in Paris 2 out of 10
Well what can be said about a horror comedy that features neither horror nor comedy? There are no characters in the film but much too many plot lines - all underdeveloped and mostly superfluousbr br The computer generated creatures look bad a bit like Disney versions of oversized rats without a tail The walking dead are the biggest rip-off apart from the title the shall look like the dead in Landis movie but are far removed They just look like bad actors with abit of plastic and bulls blood addedbr br Two plot lines really showed some promise (the love story and the company story) but failed as miserably as the director the writers the SFX department the production and the actors
This DVD is missing its calling as a Heineken coaster This is a great example of why no one should ever go see a sequel with a different directorwriter than the original Two hours of this turkey left me begging for Exorcist 2 reruns br br NO legitimate laughs NOT ONE decent scare The script was just a mess and I felt bad for the actors who had to perform it (they must have had sick relatives at home or monster coke habits or something)br br The original was a makeup effects landmark So naturally the producers of the sequel thought it would be a great idea to to scrap makeup FX and do CG werewolves instead These CG werewolves had me laughing a lot harder than any of the comedy It was just a total miss If ya want a nights entertainment go rent the original again Or go take a film class and make your own horror film Youre bound to do better than these fools did
The odd mixture of comedy and horror sometimes works and sometimes doesnt Had the main male character been a little more interesting the film would have been as well A trio of young Americans visit Paris run into a beautiful werewolf and the problems confound from therebr br Numerous logic holes make the possibly intriguing story difficult to take
I was a fan of the AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON movie and so was curious whether a 16-year later sequel could be done with French language and local re-cast major supporting and minor characters Tonight I watched the edited for FOX Network version that was some sort of curious hybrid of several hyperactive sequels The screenwriters and directors pay homage to certain of the key plot concepts: Tourist gets wolf bite full moon comes out boy meets girl boy becomes beast boy dies heroic death after help from ghost victim For me the oddest aspect of this formula teen horror special effect-ride was the casting of the school teacher-love interest of the TV comedy ED as one of the werewolfs clueless victims who is more or less totally unsympathetic in the scripted lines they handed her I havent seen another horror-flick that this movie is sequelling (a vampire fighting flick titled BLADE) but I guess that parts of its plotline must explain how villain werewolves (theyre spoofish) are threatening the good werewolf pair during a long part of the movie There is also a final conflict in a Paris subway train a la SPEED This 1997 studio product is an odd hybrid of a film since considerable technical effects are shown for scary purposes but the authentic terrors of the original have been completely undermined in my opinion Such an odd re-write of the werewolf legend and movie-mythology !?! My suggestion to those considering this at the video store -- go for a classic top of the line Thriller instead : Alfred Hitchcocks PSYCHO!
Perhaps Im being too generous when I give this film two and a half stars out of five but there was an occasional moment However as An American Werewolf movie this one is a missed chance! There are no real plot connections to the superior original to speak of but the story is similar in some ways to Londonbr br Possible Spoiler Warning American kids go to foreign country one falls in love with a beautiful girl Another one of the kids gets slaughtered by a werewolf in the same night that one gets bitten and despite his undead friends warnings by the light of the full moon he sprouts fur fangs and claws!br br But there are some differences in the story for one; the girl is one of the werewolves Second; there are three American Kids And third; theres some weird-@$$ werewolf cult intent on taking over the world! As crazy as it sounds that last one WASNT a joke! Spoiler Endsbr br The films suffers from many things first the weak acting drags it down immensely! Tom Everret Scotts performance is amatuerish at best and he and Julie Delpy who plays his love interest dont seem to have any chemistry together at all Second; A weak script that seems to be all over the place Many elements of suspense and dark comedy that made the original one great are missing in this one And whoever said that eating out the heart of the werewolf that bit you will change you back human? Last I heard this wasnt part of werewolf lore at all! Third; terrible special effects; The werewolf effects are done with computer animation which works for things such as dinosaurs ghosts and space ships But seems choppy fake and artificial when used for furry creatures like werewolvesbr br However there were a few things that saved this one from total turkeydom theres one hilarious scene in a Paris cafe when Andy (Scott) is having coffee with Serafine (Delpy) he drops a bunch of condoms on the table and tries to pass them off as chewing gum by chewing and blowing a bubble! Also; the soundtrack a very cool mix of alternative rock bands like Bush and Smashmouth Although none of the songs have the word moon in their title like the original movie the soundtrack is great nontheless And another funny scene when a rotting corpse played by Julie Bowen attempts to whistle and her eyeball pops out had me laughing out loudbr br But as a whole this film seems to lack the wit and suspense of the original And the overly contrived ending doesnt help it out much eitherbr br 12 Two and a half Out of Five Stars (Average)
God that sucked You cant end a horror movie with a happily-ever-after family setting Yeash I was kind of ambivalent going in to the final act But my god He didnt have to kill the girl she didnt die the ghost father appears with a cure (which makes no sense because his spirit would have been liberated after the yank kid killed all the bad werewolves) What a hunk of junk This is the worst horror movie Ive seen in a long time and Ive watched a lot of horror movies This is a slap in the face for Landis and everyone else involved in American Werewolf in London Blegh I hope that this ruined the career of every one in it bar Julie Delphy And CGI: Kind of new and chic back in 1997 but today it just looks drab compared to the artful prostheticmakeup work of London Anyway Im done I hope Ive scared a few people of Get the original instead or failing that The Howling Or failing that watch American Idol reruns Just dont watch this mess
Once upon a time there was a great American film Which combined horror and comedy with equal thrills This film featured clever direction Groundbreaking special effects and superb comedic and serious acting It was entitled An American Werewolf in London Sixteen years later the long awaited sequel was finally pinned onto the poster board outside your local theater Surely it would have at least some of the thrills of the original Think again An American Werewolf in Paris is an incomprehensible mess from start to pitiful finish The problems begin with the leading man Tom Everett Scotts performance is stiff and tiresome From the outset he seems intent on proving that all young people are simpletons In his defense not even a seasoned Shakespearean thespian could have extracted a good performance from the juvenile and witless dialogue At one point one of Scotts deceased friends whos soul is doomed to walk the Earth after being carved up by one of the werewolves Is finally able to leave for the afterlife He then quips to Scott and his friends Okay guys see ya What a memorable goodbye Julie Delphy soon shows up as Scotts mysterious European love interest Basically shes a French girl playing the French girl It isnt much of a stretch But all this stupidity isnt even the most disappointing thing about the film The special effects such an integral part of the superb original film fall far short in this flop The werewolves look like cartoons And no matter how well you sculpt a cartoon with sinewy lycanthrope muscles Its still hard to get scared of a cartoon So instead the vacationing American gang led by the ultra weak Scott keep finding excuses to return to the werewolfs catacombs lair Here its much easier for this incompetent special effects crew to keep the computer enhanced creatures or absurd beast masks under the cover of darkness Some have said that if you dont look on this film as a sequel its not as bad by comparison I disagree this film can not stand on its own and is even more of a disgrace when compared to the brilliant original If it doesnt want to be looked on as a sequel it should not have borrowed most of the title from the 1981 film I  dont care how much you love werewolves Or how much you worshiped American Werewolf in London as I myself did This one is simply not worth wasting your time Okay guys see ya Terrible 3 out of a possible 10 TH
Woeful and unnecessary sequel to a bonafide classic An American Werewolf in London was indisputably a gem of a movie: humorous demented with just a dash of romance and so very very British it made me want to stand up and sing God Save the Queen every time the movie ended Then came this abomination You know you are in real trouble when the leads are so utterly unlikeable you are glad when they are slaughtered and actually start cheering for the lycanthropes Tell you the truth folks I only got about half way through this CGIed travesty before losing the will to live and turning it off Absolutely pitiful and a putrid waste of anyones time
I cant honestly believe that this is a sequel or follow up of John Landis classic comedy horror movie from 1981  I suppose you cant really describe it as an original werewolf movie either since the bare bones of the story steal elements from the one set in London: An American tourist visits a famous European capital  he narrowly survives a werewolf attack that kills a colleague  he embarks ( Pardon the pun ) on a sexual relationship with someone in the medical profession  he turns into a werewolf  hes visited by apparitions of his dead victims  etc etc  and reading the previous line Ive just discovered how much the storyline has in common with the original that it seems very similar indeed  The difference lies in how enjoyable and entertaining the Landis movie is br br With this Paris based movie theres no scenes that really stand out  Theres no naked man waking up in a zoo wondering how hes going to get back home with no money or clothes  theres no bizarre dream sequence of Naziwerewolves and theres no spectacular climax  AAWIP does try to be funny but is there anything more embarrassing than failed humour ? Im thinking of the scene where Andy McDermott has to convince someone hes got chewing gum in his pocket and not condoms ! Perhaps the biggest difference between the two movies is that theres no poignancy involved with this dubious follow up  You really do feel sorry for the protagonists fate and dilemma in the London movie  here you just feel Andy is nothing more than a cypher going through the literary motions of a script  Theres also a large number of plot holes visible  Is this the first time The Lunar Club have carried out a massacre ? If not then arent large numbers of corpses with their hearts torn out been reported in the worlds press ? Why havent the police got leads ?br br Everyone else has mentioned it and so will I - The visuals are poor  Look at the bungee jumping scene at The Eifell Tower  its painfully obvious that its achieved via some blue screen projection while the werewolf transformation is done by some very cartoonish CGI  I wont put Anthony Waller in the same bracket as Stephen Sommers as a director who totally ruins a movie because of an over reliance on CGI ( The major problem with AAWIP is the screenplay coupled with a high degree of expectation from those who saw the 1981 movie classic ) but I would have preferred the Rick Baker type special effects used for the transformation  To be fair its reasonable to speculate that perhaps the budget didnt stretch that far  But at the end of the day this is a fairly poor horror movie that didnt need to be made and DOG SOLDIERS is much better entertainment
Lets describe Larry as an interviewer: a complete suckhole in every way possible He laughs at all his guests jokes he asks the most boring questions and he would never dare contradict them He hits me as the type of person who wants to be liked byeveryone Friendly boring olpredictable Harry He probably owes his success to being a dream interviewer for celebrities because they dont get bombarded with what we the people want to know and have a right to know Lets put it this way: he interviews as if hes in a red country 0210 2 for the guests that come on the show yet it all seems pointless when Larry starts asking his mind numbing questions such as Whats it like to be a mother? followed by the usual answer along the lines of Being a mother is the greatest thing that ever happened to me: its wonderful but tiring
Larry is a perfect example of the Democratic Party in the United States of which he is a staunch member King used to be somewhat fair and unbiased and had a variety of guests on The Party used to be centrist too but that was another era Now like Larry its Far Left br br At least 90 percent of all the guests on Kings show in the past year or two are Liberals who sit there and bash President Bush and every Conservative they can think ofnight after night Bill Mahar one of the more viscous ones is - and you can look this up - the most frequent guest in the history of Kings TV show You can count on other outspoken Left Wingers to be on Kings show each week but dont hold your breath waiting for a Conservative They are few and far betweenbr br King was also one of the innovators of the media overkill That all began with the OJ Simpson trial Night after night after night thats all you ever saw back in the mid 90s Whatever latest gossip on Anna Nicole Smith or the Petersen murder case or Paris Hilton Britney Spears or some other tabloid subject you can bet Larry will beat it to death Sadly all the other networks do the same thing now Larry was a leader in that regardbr br King also has the nerve to sometimes give advice such as on marriage I am not kidding; I ve heard him say it The joke is that he has been married and divorced a half dozen times! This man has few scruples believe me When it comes to morality he is clueless Maybe thats why he has Dr Phil on to explain some facts of life to him regularly Larry will nod but he doesnt understand any more than when Billy Graham used to talk to himbr br King also is becoming famous for the softball interview meaning he asks no hard questions That is a lot due to the fact that most his guests are of his political persuasion People know being on Kings show is liking having an hour public relations gigbr br What all this has meant is a serious decline in ratings the past five years People see through him and his Liberal-and-tabloid-TV mentality and switched over from King and CNN to Fox News
Every time I watch Larry King Live he rolls out the most softball questions for his guests He rarely gets any useful information because he doesnt ask the hard questions This comes from his start on radiobr br King established himself on the radio and basically has not changed one bit of the format for television except for his talking head being visible He becomes like a puppy for his guests & the only time he really gets useful information from them is whee they volunteer it or a caller to the show actually asks a hard questionbr br Larry is a nice fatherly type of interviewer This means he should not have a prime time show on a major news network if you consider CNN one I dont because of the history of CNNbr br Copying (ie Cable) New Network was started by Ted Turner as an alternative to network news in that it could broadcast news 247 When it first started the only TV competition was from NBCABC & CBS Because of this CNN Copied the format of their competition & achieved respectable ratings br br This worked fine for CNN until they got competing networks which were innovative & provided better fresher news coverage In response to the heating up of competition CNN went into denial & panned its competitors who were eating their lunch & ratings because CNN wanted to resist change This didnt work very long & their ratings began to plummetbr br Now the Copying News Network is trying to re mold itself by re-inventing itself by copying the leading news network format Unfortunately this show represents a big piece of the problem It is 21 years old & showing its age very badly br br Sorry to say King needs to be moved out of Prime Time or scrapped altogether
To be fair I didnt see a lot of this show Probably because it wasnt as good as the original MASH but I seem to recall them moving it around on the weekly schedule Some shows just arent worth the trouble of following around every week But I really did try at first so it wasnt all bad Maybe I just kept expecting it to improve but I cant give this show a 1 In all honesty I cant give it any more than a 2 eitherbr br It wasnt MASH (Im not going to type those stupid s every time) And it was trying to be MASH without putting forth any effort like it would just magically happen Well guess what? No magic The best I can do here is to compare it to other showsbr br Trapper John MD was a much better show by far However they should have called it BJ Hunnicut MD because Pernell Roberts looked exactly like an older BJ but nothing at all like Trapper John Keep everything else the same just change his name and the name of the show Presto! After MASH wasnt the only sequel to completely bomb and dishonor the original Archie Bunkers Place was a lame follow-up to All In The Family It had no heart no conflict no depth  all of the things that made All In the Family so memorable Likewise MASH was funny because the doctors were reacting to the impossible absurdity of war Remove the war and you remove the drive for 99% of the humor Potter cant yell at Klinger for wearing a dress because Klinger isnt wearing a dress because hes not trying to get kicked out of the Army because hes already out of the Army because the war is over (breathe) All of the jokes became forced because there was no motivation for anything The least motivated was the viewer to stay around and watch the showbr br And from what I remember the whole show seemed to be Potter Klinger and Mulcahy just standing there unnaturally facing the audience like a trio of Vaudeville performers It was reminiscent of Good Times where they spent 90% of the show standing behind that couch and talking to the audience trying to make it look like they were having natural conversation They werent And it felt even less natural on After MASHbr br Another random tidbit I recall is that the people who made MASH never got any royalties from the spin-off The studio used the absurd excuse that After MASH was really a spin-off of the movie MASH (which they owned) and not the TV series Nice try but Mulcahy was the only one of the three in the movie and he was never deaf I guess studio execs will do anything for a buck Anything other than make a worthwhile sequel that is
Rose  Does anything actually happen in this episode? It introduces our two leads a slow-witted grinning idiot of a Doctor and an utterly un-interesting companion Theres no plot to speak of childish humour mixed with some extremely bad pacing and incidental music What else is there to say really?br br The End of the World  A marginal improvement in that we see our first outer-space scenario Subsequently brought down by poor contemporary humour paper-thin logic very poor pacing and tired SF clichésbr br The Unquiet Dead  Best episode to date showing what can happen when someone knows how to structure an episode write interesting character dialogue AND integrate an intriguing plot Let down solely by the Doctor and Rosebr br Aliens of LondonWorld War Three - Doctor who degenerates into farce What more can be said Penelope Wilton brings the proceedings a little gravity trying her best in dire circumstances Some poorly written and out-of-place soap opera elements come to the fore in these two episodes and a return to poor pacing bad plotting and cringe worthy humoursatirebr br Dalek  Not great however still far above the RTD fare to date The pacing and script are all fine (though the Doctor and Rose still irritate) The effects and menace of the Dalek are introduced well The finale however took an interesting premise that reduced the Doctors most notorious foe into a cuddly touchy-feely mess and turning a previously un-seen menace to a blue rubber squid that looked like a childs toybr br The Long Game - The first RTD script to show any plot even if it was in a clichéd 80s style Still it was marred somewhat by his usual over-reliance on juvenile jokes placing it too far in the future to make logical sense and again poor pacing Not as bad as his previous efforts but instantly forgettablebr br Fathers Day  The initial premise couldve been vaguely interesting but common sense and logic abandon this episode from the very beginning Also we are treated to a whole episode of Soap Opera Before you start thinking this is all about characterization remember theres a big difference between lame Soap Opera and characterization On the plus side it does prove RTD isnt the worst script writer so farbr br The Empty ChildThe Doctor Dances - This started off in a mediocre way with some cringe worthy moments and some illogical mistakes that even a primary school pupil wouldnt make (Well lit windows in a blackout anyone?) After this the first part takes a more interesting and sinister turn Florence Hoath truly steals these episodes showing us what an interesting companion couldve been like She could also act Instead we get the annoying and politically correct Captain Jack as the new companion The conclusion was a little hasty but sufficient The pacing and script improved with a reasonably good storyline making these two episodes quite atmospheric and intriguing br br Boom Town - I have to be honest except for a few examples I had been so disillusioned by the current series that upon seeing the trailer for another Slitheen episode I gave up and didnt subject myself to the torturebr br Bad Wolf - Reality TV arguably the worst facet of the modern media is basically used as the premise Theres no subtlety whatsoever Do we get any interesting social commentary as in the likes of The Running Man or Truman Show? No of course not This in an RTD episode so theyre basically here to cynically try and pull in the audience of said shows Once again logic goes out the window as were placed 200000-something years in the future RTD tries pointlessly to shoe-horn in some over-arcing story here with no relevance other than its own existence and when the villains are revealed at the end They make empty threats and the Doctor grins once more like an idiot for the climax! Faster paced for the most part than RTDs other efforts this has one or two interesting moments Otherwise another lacklustre instalmentbr br The Parting of the Ways - The big finale More of a damp squid literally All of the Dalek menace set up in Dalek is brought crashing down as they become rather pathetic So many plot holes riddle this episode with typically poor contrivances Daleks want to harvest humans as Daleks but then vaporize entire continents? Daleks can vaporize said continents but not destroy the Tardis in space? The Tardis is now indestructible and can land anywhere even over people so they can be saved in it? This ability cant be used to easily destroy the Dalek god? The Daleks can vaporize entire continents but dont just nuke satellite 5 to destroy the doctor and instead let him play around? The doctor is a pathetic coward without the conviction of his actions after eradicating his whole species to try and eliminate the Daleks? These and many other holes aside we are treated to the lamest dues ex machina solution ever conceived joined with a near pointless story arcbr br So what can we say about the new series all-in-all?br br Would this have gained a second series if it were anything other than Doctor Who with RTD behind it? Would most of the episodes have been seen as anything other than un-original and forgettable if they were anything other than Doctor Who and had RTDs name attached? I think notbr br Some people would have us think we cant say anything against RTD since we owe him for bringing Doctor Who back to our screens However this at the expense of good characters and stories Personally Id rather not have a poorly planned ill conceived product churned out at that price Id rather wait till someone could come along and make a genuine effort For the most part this is the kind of puerile rubbish that gives SF a bad name marring what is otherwise the most creative genre
I a huge fan of when it comes to Doctor Who series and still am But I was very disappointed when i began to watch this new seriesbr br Children under the age of 15 or even better under the age of 10 will probably will enjoy it the best and possibly new fans who havent seen any of the original series But as far as fans of the original series will find this series missing much of the charm the made the original series so great It took David Tennant to get me to Appreciate how Much better Christoper Eccellestion was as a Doctor in the 1st seasonbr br I would only recommend this series for people who havent seen much of the original series people who are under 15 and EXTREMELY DIE HARD who fans everyone else will just get a laugh and mumble curse words about Russel T Davies screwed up one of our favorite TV shows
From the weeks and weeks of promotion for this ABCs The One was supposed to be The Real World meets American Idol We were to watch these singers perform compete and see how they lived together in a house as well The Drama! The Tension! br br Where does one begin with this atrocity? Lets start with the judges who were known as Music Experts on this program Experts implies they have expertise Andre Harrell at least had a pedigree He was in charge of Motown Records for a time The other two eh Kate Hudsons uncle who could have been labeled Mr Weird Beard He dyed his facial hair three distinctly different florescent colors I wonder how scary he would have been with a black light! And The Paula Abdul wannabe who did something I didnt think could happen: she was even more gushing and cloying than Paula! She then over corrected and became harshly critical after the first episode The farce of critiques that these three offered was a true joke and an insult not only to the process of finding the best singer but to the audience that is now quite savvy already having done this numerous times on Foxbr br There was the host George Stroumboulopoulos was no Ryan Seacrest In fact he was as lackluster as can be He actually sucked what little energy there was in the program dry How he got that job was the second biggest mystery of the showbr br The first was how did they pick the 11 competitors for this program? This was literally a talent-free talent show OK Perhaps thats an exaggeration And granted the performers all have to be relatively close in ability because if they were not there wouldnt be a contest If only one person was good there would be no suspense So I get that they all needed to be comparable But they all should have had some chops! Additionally the judges were running a Singing Academy so the program was part Fame as well Clearly these performers desperately needed those lessons But you need some extremely talented people to teach those with little talent to be talented And that definitely wasnt what was happening herebr br It seemed in casting the show the priority was on the homelife elements as all of the players were very attractive to look at in equal parts to how badly they vocalized But the filmed segments in their house were so chopped and sliced you couldnt get into the stories that were starting to happen so the show didnt capture the events there eitherbr br As badly devised as all of that was The One had an incredible unbelievable fatal design flaw built into the results that made it completely laughablebr br The audience phoned in their votes for who they liked the best just like on AI But then after the audience vote was revealed the bottom three contestants were forced to sing a final song The music experts based on that performance chose one person from the three to save for the following week And THEN the contestants who were safe got to vote for who they wanted to keep from the remaining two sending the remaining contestant homebr br The design flaw was that the contestants had the final say I mean if you were in a music competition and you wanted to get as far along the path as you could would you vote to KEEP the better singer or would you try to get rid of your toughest rival? Any first season viewer of CBSs Survivor could answer that one! And thats exactly what happened on the program The person who had the better potential was lost and the contestants voted back the one who had no talent at all! On top of that the contestant who was just saved from the bottom by the experts was also allowed to vote against the remaining two! It was a complete farce! br br Maybe if they let the contestants vote first at least the experts would save the better of two evils to finish But this just confirms how not ready this show was for broadcast how unsatisfying the whole process was to view and how misguided the producers were in attempting it
No surprise except in how quickly ABC reacted to the dismal ratings According to published reports (Variety) the show garnered the worst ratings in the history of the ABC television networkbr br And I quote: ABCs music talent competition The One opened Tuesday night to cancel-me-now ratingsbr br The article went on to say that the show received a shockingly low 11 rating3 share in adult 18-49 and 308 million viewers overallbr br That makes it the weakest premiere for any reality show on any network and also below all series bows in ABC historybr br From the first moment I saw the commercials for this I knew it would fail We dont need another American Idol clone But ABC should have given this show a fair chance to succeed
The One is a very aptly name show mostly because it comes close to being the only network shows on in prime time that barely more than one person is watchingbr br When I first heard of The One I thought to myself Weee!! Another sing-song show! We dont have enough of those! and then proceeded to strap on my helmet and run about my home hitting my head on blunt objects and sharp corners Because in all honesty the constant year round pain and suffering inflicted by having only one or two talent based reality shows running just isnt enough We needed another one And not just any one - THE One The one with slightly less attractive contestants with slightly less talent The one with slightly less of a point though its hard to imagine a scenario in which thats possible The one with pointless footage of the contestants when theyre not performing included Because I care what Johnny Sings-a-lot does in his off hours! I really do! Now you may be thinking Hey! On the entire continent of North America less than 4 million people watched the first episode Doesnt that mean this show sucks? Well to that I say less than 4 million people in North America have syphilis so sometimes low numbers bring good news now dont they? Think about itbr br In the end The One may be horribly unoriginal a show that even the airing network couldnt be bothered to promote because they too realize how absolutely worthless it is but its still not syphilis! Yay!
Poor second-string feature from Universal Pictures about a mamas boy movie actor doing criminal investigation work for the military fending off the advances of the brash young woman hes been assigned to romance Robert Montgomery directed and stars in this adaptation of the short story Come Be My Love and his acting performances of this era are unrelievedly lazy The plot is sappy predictable stuff and writer Robert Carson has given all the really funny lines (as usual for films of this period) to the feisty black maid Its always nice to see Ann Blyth and Jane Cowl in support but they cant do much with this hokey material  from 
After the turning point of NIGHT MUST FALL Robert Montgomery (for the most time) came into his finest films and performances: HERE COMES MR JORDAN THEY WERE EXPENDABLE THE LADY IN THE LAKE RIDE THE PINK HORSE THE SAXON CHARM JUNE BRIDE Even some of the failures he was in were interesting enough to be still watchable (RAGE IN HEAVEN MR AND MRS SMITH) But Montgomery wanted to do more and more production and directing work In 1949 he made what would be his last movie performance - he played Collier Lang an egotistical movie star who is dragged into helping the authorities do an investigation about a young girls boyfriendbr br Apparently my view of this film is a minority view Most of the views given are favorable about it I thought it was a dull witless script with Ann Blyths groupie heroine not very appealing as a character She admires Montgomery as a star and this helps when he is called in to assist the authorities but after awhile I found there was no chemistry between them The script was also devoid of much fun although Montgomery and Roland Winters did try The only thing I recall to this day as a joke point was that Taylor Holmes is the wealthy father of Blyth and he is an admirer of Winston Churchill So he always dresses up as Churchill and we see him wearing a floppy broad brimmed hat smoking a large cigar and painting (Holmes bald head helps in the disguise) That was the most memorable joke from this film - not much of a real memorybr br Montgomery went into early television and finally won the attention and respect he always had deserved in motion pictures His last contact with the movies was his direction of THE GALLANT HOURS about Admiral William Bull Halsey starring his friend Jimmy Cagney It is a far better film than this For his overall film and television career I will give this mediocre film a 4 That strikes me as generous
Less than two hundred and fifty years ago the last of the great pirates wrote their names in blood and fire across the pages of maritime history This is the story of a buccaneer Captain whose name for one short year struck terror in the hearts of seafarers and merchants from the ports of the Caribbean to the trading houses of Londonbr br Hmm that opening to the film sounds like we are in for one hell of a swashbuckling pillaging ripper of a movie doesnt it? Well its not Tho its not totally without value as a curio piece Out of 20th Century Fox Anne Of The Indies is adapted by Philip Dunne & Arthur Caesar from a short story written by Herbert Ravenel Sass Direction is by Jacques Tourneur the score is by Franz Waxman and Harry Jackson is providing the Technicolor photography Jean Peters is in the titular title role of Anne {AKA Captain Providence} and support comes from Louis Jourdan Debra Paget Herbert Marshall Thomas Gomez & James Robertson Justicebr br Originally meant to be be based on true life pirate Anne Bonny the film ultimately turns out to be a tale of a woman seeking identity and finding herself in the predominantly male led world of piracy and sea based shenanigans Filled with clichés and over familiar set pieces the film also suffers from a cast that is largely misfiring Peters gives it a right good go and Paget lights up the screen with effervescent beauty While Robertson Justice although underused actually looks the part and doesnt overact like the rest of the male cast does Some reviewers have desperately tried to dig deep into the film to find intelligence and hidden meanings purely because its Tourneur in the directing chair But there is no depth here this is merely a job for Tourneur a professional one granted but its thinly plotted and actually lacking swash to go with the buckle in the action stakes br br Disposable at best 410
Alien was excellent Many writers tried to copy it They all did a bad job (or almost) But Dead Space is the worst Alien copy Because of the bad actors the bad special effects the BAD scenario and other bad stuff (it would take about 3 pages to tell everything that is bad in this film The movie wasnt very long and this is a very good thing (the only one) You cannot laugh because it is too seriousthat is a bad thing because in almost each B-series sci-fi film you can laugh during the whole time It can be terrific sometimes but instead of watching this stupidity just watch Alien or Event Horizonthese are much better!!! I give it 1 out of 5
I am the kind of person who can enjoy a good B Movie if it has some kind of redeeming value to it but Dead Space has nothing to redeem it! This is the kind of film that will make you frustrated restless and sick to your stomach br br Bad acting Lame story Terrible effects Horrible excruciating dialogue Dead Space has it all!
The filmmakers apparently had enough money to be able to afford decent makeup effects but not enough for a creature that would move around and attack convincingly We never get a chance to see the monster move from one place to another - whenever that happens (supposedly) the camera focuses on the terrified reactions of the humans that are nearby And when a man is attacked by it he simply seems to be holding an inanimate object against himself so that it wont fall to the ground This is still not the worst Alien rip-off around (the two Xtro films are even worse for example); its actually sufficiently entertaining if youve got 68 (!!) minutes to spare (12)
How can anyone even begin to like this film is really beyond mebr br The idea? It has none A guy fell apart Thats the idea Wow An environment was slowly killing him now THATs original and worth watchingbr br This is the first Fasbinders film Ive seen Ive heard that hes a genius of mise-en-scene but Ive seen student films with more attention inspiration idea and craft than this this this nothing It has nothing!br br Each and every shot is too long Theres so much emptiness in them The actings horrible You can see the actors had no preparation at all no understanding of their roles not even an attempt at showing emotions its so superficial The lines are so explicative that you could removed 90% of them and still have the same crappy film Tempo? Who cares about it Atmosphere dynamics thats for pussies! One shot per scene 80% of the time people staring unrealistically having no idea how to represent emotions and importance of the moment besides hollow staring at the camera or one another EDiting? All rules of editing have been disregarded with no pa pay-off of any kind Photography? Half of the shots have reflection in them and crappy lighting with no stylization of any kind Shadows play of shadows who needs that? We need a guy pissing drinking hitting his wife like hes like hes acting We need a bunch of close ups of a not-so-beautiful woman we need an amateurish climax of his capture by an unconvincing arabian torturer This film has so much wrongs that it isnt worth the no-budget it hadbr br Frankly I havent seen a film this bad since American Pie 5 Yup That badbr br Ive just started watching his Veronica Foss movie which seems much better based on the first 15 minutes (since it does have a hint of directing and artistic idea unlike this crap) so I wont argue that Fasbinders clueless but this this film SUCKS!
the movie is precious and cage is a babe br br but will anyone agree with me in saying that the punk representation in this movie is ATROCIOUS?!?! br br wheres the clash? the ramones?? misfits? social distortion? the cramps?? sex pistols?! ANYONE?!?!?!?! the music is this movie is incredibly disappointing! at LEAST they play the curebr br plus randys feathered hair and pleated khakisbr br this definitely looks like a movie about punks the way that a bunch of movie industry squares see punksbr br although its a 90s movie SLC punk paints a much more accurate picture of the punk rock scene in the early 1980s just sayin
I must say that I wasnt impressed at all probably because I was expecting much more from this movie Maybe an accent on religion vs science or on the meaning of life not just a few lines So if you expect something to think about after you see this movie dont Its more psychological than philosophical I vote 4 because of the end it clears up a bit and because I have a great respect for BBC documentaries There are a couple of very interesting scenes that actually gave some sense It was a brilliant idea to add it in a movie related to theory of evolution too bad that this wasnt the main subject Ah I just forgot to say that for more than 1 hour the movie is quite boring and in a way cruel
I had high hopes going to see this as I always enjoy Paul Bettanys performances I thought he was very good as Darwin and did his best considering the terrible material he had to work withbr br Darwins book On the Origin of Species was one of the most ground-breaking controversial and innovative publications ever yet youd never think it based on this tedious movie Its like a two-hour episode of a soap opera in a Victorian setting There is virtually nothing about Darwins five-year voyage on The Beagle to the Galapagos Islands for example surely of supreme significance to the story as it was from his investigations of the wildlife thereon that he began to form his theory of evolutionbr br This is just one long dreary domestic drama with Darwin portrayed as a slightly loopy eccentric seeing visions of his dead daughter everywhere and being given the cold shoulder by his emotionally-constipated wife Jennifer Connellys portrayal of Emma Darwin is nothing short of awful and bears little relation to historical descriptions of the real Emma There could have been an opportunity here to present the creationist interpretation of life on earth from either Emma or from the local priest as played by Jeremy Northam (a blink-and-youd-miss-it part which is a complete waste of a talented actor) to act as a counterbalance to Darwins views but it wasnt taken up br br The story focused too much on endless mawkish sentiment about Darwins grief for his daughter Annie and too much time was also wasted in Darwin wondering whether or not to write his book Eventually I was so bored it was difficult to care br br All in all this was a bit like making a movie about Picasso and spending two hours concentrating on him having a fight with his girlfriend and not bothering to mention that he was an artist
I wish I could tell you that this film is as exciting as the theories it espouses But I cant Another species could have come and mutated while I waited for some action For such a controversial man Darwin lived the most conventional life If you didnt know about the mad theories you could almost mistake him for a stamp collectorbr br The film-makers have cast Darwin as a dullard which does him a disservice Even when he briefly loses his mind due to his tireless theorising it wasnt interesting to watch Maybe great thinkers are dull people? I dont know what I was expecting: a forehead-banging eccentric with wild hair and eyes espousing his love of all things simian the glint of madness straining from a furrowed brow? A long-haired hermit who babbled to animals? A head-cradling lunatic with eyes lit up like beacons of truth? All of the above would have been great This is the movies for Scorseses sakebr br But there was none of that No lightning no thunder no wonder no awe Just Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly fresh from the Subtle as Breath School of Method Acting I imagine that someone with Darwins ideas had a brain like a speeding train so why did this film just pootle along - chug chug chug - like a slow winter? The disappointment is immeasurable
what a waste of a film once again the film industry does not trust to make a film that could have been just about the mans ideas there is virtually nothing on his theories or evolution instead the most boring story of home life and relationship with one daughter a ponderous script great liberties taken with Darwins life dialogue given to his character that i find hard to believe he would have voiced Darwin never gave up his believe in a higher power he may not quite rightly have believed in the established Christian idea of God  but was not an atheist which this film implies what would have been a riveting and much better film is if they had started with the publication of On the Origin of Species and constructed a story of the great revolution that entailed and of an amazing cast of characters involved on all sides instead we got a plodding boring drama mostly made up a great injustice
How to take Charles Darwins fantastic intellectual journey and turn it into a chick flick His pivotal and seminal ideas and their radical influence on Western thought and capitalist society are untouched except for two brief scenes in one of which it is claimed he is killing God; pure demagoguery to make the movie emotional And the rest of the movie buckles to that purpose: it consists entirely of melodramatic and long family scenes with overloud music at which one is beholden to cry Anyone who actually read Origin Of Species would be vividly aware that there was no breach with God in any of Darwins work; to the contrary there was an increased awe and respect and a revolutionary new way of looking at things A good movie about Darwin could be educational thoughtful and deeply inspiring even in a religious sense - but that would contradict the soap-opera intentions of this flick This is a flick that is designed to make people wail in contrived sympathy and then feel transformed although unable to understand why; it makes fast use of Darwins great name only as marketing clout as one would drop a famous name at a party to create an impression Sad that the sets and costumes are so good: production values except for the writing were obviously high See it if you want to weep for the loss of intelligence in American literature
I can remember reading that Darwin had a pivotal experience in the Galapagos islands seeing the vast range of animal life there and intern penned his theory of evolution Not according to this movie-it was inspired by the British countryside OK and as John Cleese would say-Right- I also did not think that Darwin was a man suffering from deep personal conflict and someone who suffered dark reveries and flights of anguish According to this film he was It is sad that he apparently lost one of his daughters to illness but I dont think him losing a family member would have impacted on the mans scientific abilities very much Well not according toyou get the picture I think there is nothing worse than when science gets turned into fable and to an extent this film comes off as trying to debunk evolutionary theory by saying it came from a man who was emotionally unstable which to me is just plain gross I think Charles Darwin was the soul of scientific enquiry cool and calm and always thinking logically This film seeks to dramatize the undramatic and sensationalize clear headed scientific exploration It is like a Canterbury Tale I would not recommend it
This could have been a great movie with plenty of educational potential for teachers around the world about evolution biology the creative work in science research and Darwins life but it is notbr br The screenplay is mostly historically inaccurate and transforms a true story into a Mexican soup-opera melodrama While it is true that Darwin gradually lost his religious beliefs this was in great part due to his findings during the voyage of the Beagle and not solely due to the loss of his daughter He was certainly disturbed by his loss but that did not made him literally insane delusional and detached from his friends and family The such portrayal of Darwin is an invention of the script writer Thus it cannot be used in any way as place to learn a bit about Darwins life and psyche According to most historians Darwin had the theory ready by the end of the Beagle voyage and kept it from going public because he wanted to develop further the consequences of it and check against more data In the movie it is an imaginary conflict of Darwin with his religious beliefs and the mental illness that he developed after his daughters death that kept him from going publicbr br The movie brings a modern situation the creationists vs scientists debate into the life and times of Darwin thus it is anachronistic It depicts Thomas Huxley not as a man trying to develop further understanding of biology but as someone eager to kill God in his own words from the movie and destroy the church who would accept the theory of evolution for such purposes and not because it was a synthesis of plenty of disconnected data Huxley is presented as a very arrogant and insensible person a combination that I interpret was an attempt to ridicule active atheists who speak up against religion In real life Huxley accepted Darwins ideas after publication only gradually and before the work of Darwin he thought that there was not enough evidence to support evolution His first support of evolution was published one month after the Origin of Species became public He was agnostic but did not think it was necessary to kill God only thought that there was not enough evidence to believe in the supernatural The debate creationists vs scientists appears throughout the movie and creationists catch-phrases such as It is only a theory are part of the discussion Of course no such dispute or catch-phrases existed at that time In fact the Anglican Church published a positive review of the Origins saying that they saw Gods work in evolution in some sense quite in fact in contradiction to the way that the clergy is portrayed in the screenplaybr br Another awful aspect of this movie is that it gives the wrong impression to the general public that scientific research is done by a solitary crazy man who just writes a lot Nothing could be further from the truth The conception of the theory of evolution was the result of thorough observations of living forms by Darwin during five years in the HMS Beagle and was developed gradually as it can be seen from Darwins notes of the voyage Even though the Beagle voyage was the sole most important part of Darwins life to the conception of Origin of Species the voyage is briefly mentioned only once at the beginning and no attempt is made to show that the book came as an elaborate analysis of observations To make it worse Darwin is shown performing a single experiment (pigeon breeding) to test his theory and in the end quits it And Im not really sure whether such experiment did actually occurbr br Great disappointment It is not in any way a homage to Darwin and science
Man with the Screaming Brain is a story of greed betrayal and revenge in the a small Bulgarian town William Cole wealthy industrialist winds up with part of his brain replaced by that of a Russian cab driver Yegor The two couldnt be more different but they share one thing - both were killed by the same woman Brought back to life by a mad scientist William and Yegor form an unlikely partnership to track down their common nemesisbr br Bruce Campbell returns to the B horror movie genre that gave him his cult status this time not only in front of the screen but behind the lens Unfortunately for this time around the laughs dont deliver and Campbell has to resort to what he does best to try and fill the gap in this filmbr br As a fan of Campbell who has the movies the books and the action figures I was hoping for another hit to add to my collection Although after seeing this film before the purchase I am glad that I dont have the pleasure of adding itbr br The film first goes wrong in the story which at first sight seems like harmless fun but turns out to be boring drawn out dribble Which is a sad thing to say because it was written by Mr Campbell himself The comedy never really hits it only makes us scratch our heads It seems that Campbell ran out of things that are funny and resulted in giving the audience what weve already seenhim fighting himselfbr br Ted Raimi the brother of Evil Dead director Sam Raimi is undoubtedly the highlight of the film He brings a freshness to it and an entertaining time when the film really needs it It helps if you are a fan and have been following these stooges from Evil Dead to Xena which is why I felt compelled to like this filmbr br Campbells experience as a director from directing episodes of the TV series Hercules is apparent Campbell makes the film work well enough even with the low-budget In the end there arent as many things going for this as one would hope for but the fans of Campbell will stick behind it no matter what unfortunately for this fanI wont
Lets get one thing out of the way I am a HUGE Bruce Campbell fan I have the Evil Dead series have the action figures and have seen Bubba Ho-Tep I am a fan of cheesy laughable horror flicks and know how to appreciate the whole its so bad its good deal br br I wish I could say the same about this movie I watched this movie with high expectations I wanted it to be good campy something from the BC we have all come to know and love It started out promising enough but after the first 20 minutes I resided to watching the rest of this sorry excuse of a movie as if I had just been shot with tranquilizer darts br br The idea itself isnt a bad one; two men dont get along both killed by the same psycho woman half of one mans brain is transplanted into the others head they argue disagree and the comedy ensues br br What killed me is how extremely unorganized and boring it was! It had potential even as a camp flick to be so much better than it was The plot was boring even Bruces zany physical slap stick couldnt make it work br br Words cannot even properly express the ridiculous robot that Bruces wifes brain ends up getting put into Easily the worst looking robot I have ever seen anywhere (even for a B movie) The whole idea is dumb br br What the hell was going through Bruces mind when he made this steaming pile is beyond me Why Ted Raimi didnt go running to his big brother asking him to slap some sense into Bruce and not to mention some lessons about making an enjoyable movie on a budget is beyond mebr br Shame on you Bruce!!!
I enjoy B movies I think Bruce Campbell is a very watchable actor I love how he delivers his lines Evil Dead 2 and Army of Darkness were great movies I liked Running Time However I dont know if Ill ever watch this movie againand I bought it Now after saying that I bet the commentary tracks and special features will be worth watching! This movie just has far too many holes for me to actually enjoy even as a cheapo movie First off Ted Raimi was annoying just flat out annoying There was nothing to his badly acted  written character that hasnt been done better a thousand times before The directing sadly was sub par and the choice of some shotsyikes I dont expect Woody Allen or James Cameron here but Campbell did not deliverbr br I did not purchase this thinking it was going to be an Oscar movie like Annie Hall but still Im disappointed I would have been happy with Mallrats or The Rhino Brothers I got much less By the end of the movie there were no scenes that popped out to me no dialogue that resonated within me Even Hostel had a classic line for petes sake! I do not recommend this movie
I just saw this movie last night at a midnight sneak preview screening (I work for an independent theatre chain in Colorado - its one of the perks)Im sorry but this is one of THE WORST movies Ive ever seen! I know that there are some Bruce Campbell fanatics out there who (like Star Wars die-hards) will string you up from the nearest tree if you DARE speak any ill of their beloved cinematic iconnevertheless Campbell-teers this particular work from The Chin is a celluloid black holebr br Before you make any assumptions that Im some hoity-toity film buff who only watches real movies like Ladies in Lavender and Sideways think again - Im a huge fan of B-movies and Bruce Campbell in particular His trademark character Ash is one of my favorites and his portrayal of the aging Elvis in Bubba Ho-Tep was phenomenalbr br But hey B-movies still have the potential to be reeeeally reeeeally bad (and not in that good campy way we all love)and thats what watching this particular one was like for me and my fellow co-workers With the exception of that one tracking shot where Bruce runs through the square and scares the kids there were no laughs to be had Overall we found the story to be mind-numbingly stoopid the pacing mollasses-like and the so-called humor dumber than a bag of hammers (Im sorry but Ted Raimis Pavel character was not comic reliefhe was just plain retarded!) Believe me we all went into this really wanting to like it but left feeling incredibly disappointed and robbed of two hoursbr br If you absolutely loved this movie plan to see it multiple times want to marry and have kids with it etc thats fantastic - we all like what we like so you get no judgement from me But dont go questioning the sense of humor or fan loyalty of those who arent having multiple orgasms over Campbells latest cinematic coupe This flick was a steaming turd sandwich in my humble opinionand as a true Campbell fan Im allowed to say that!
Guys what can I tell you? Im Bulgarian I cant remember how many times I talk to Americans and let alone that they dont have a slightest clue where is Bulgaria but they say things like: Theres a war going on there right? or Ive never imagined that in a place like Bulgaria people have Internet Go watch Bruce Campbells The Man With The Screaming Brain I was curious about this movie cause 1) Im Bruce Campbell fan - Evil Dead trilogy and The Adventures of Brisco County Jr 2) The movie was shot entirely on location in Bulgaria the second after Alien Apocalypse which is also nearly unwatchable 3) I enjoy nice B-moviesbr br Well The movie presents our country like a never-ending Gypsy Town where they raid your car wave around illegal guns and you can get killed any moment And Bruces line Bull$h1t Bulgaria is more than offendingbr br Ted Raimi and Stacy Ceach make a great team Bruce does his special - beats himself up and thats all Nothing more to see herebr br Peoeple give this movie 10 just because of Bruces cult status but it doesnt deserve more than 3 Waste of film
My brain was screaming why do you keep watching! Turn it off and go to bed! But couch potatoness won out and I watched until the predictable ending I guess when its Bruce Campbell I need to give it a chancebr br I find it hard to complain about a low budget movie purely because of the low budget time and time again we see low budget movies proving that a good story good writing and good acting are enough to make a good movie Ted and Bruce got their start on just such a movie but they didnt seem to learn from Sam that it takes a bit more than slapping it on film to make a moviebr br Its sad too because Bruce has always been a favorite After the 70s and 80s I just cant believe movies this bad are still being made Bruce Im really disappointed
Im 35 Bruce was THE man in Evil Dead and I still love to watch ED1 and ED2 It was cool also to see him as The King two or three years ago in Bubba Ho Tep in which he showed versatility and great acting talent But this Screaming Brain adventure is certainly not for Bruces early fans Either Im getting too old for this sh17 or Im just not part of Bruces target audience anymore Im positive kids age 9 to 13 will love this film But this over extended matinée sci-fi comedy contains about 5 minutes total of interesting moments and the rest is cheap kids slapstick humor Campbell better talk seriously with Sam Raimi and get their brains screaming together for a last Evil Dead reunion picture to get back my interest At least there would be a good director behind the camera Sorry Bruce this just doesnt cut it for me Take care
Written by directed by and starring the champ of camp Bruce Campbell Easy on its easy to tell this is a budget on a shoestring affair; filmed independently in Bulgaria All I can really say for sure is that silly is not always funny Campbell plays an affluent American business man with a cheating wife(Antoinette Byron)and trying to close a business transaction before he is murdered He hires a cabbie to drive him around a strange little town; not knowing that his wife is carrying on with the taxi driver Within moments of Campbell being bludgeoned; the cabbie is killed in the same location A mad scientist(Stacy Keach)proceeds with an experiment putting the cabbies brain inside the Americans head With massive stitches on his forehead Campbell breaks free and roams the streets looking for his wife; all the while he is arguing with a strange voice inside his over-sized head Campbell contorts his rubbery face making silly expressions as he argues with himself Thus Bruce is doing what he does best and no doubt his many fans will be pleased I get the impression this must have been written as a straight comedy Rounding out the cast are Ted Raimi Tamara Gorski and Vladmir Kolev Watch for this on the Sci-Fi Channel
As a Bruce Campbell fan for nearly two decades I was thrilled to have an opportunity to see his latest film on the big screen with the man himself in attendance Unfortunately Man with the Screaming Brain was itself a disappointmentbr br Set in Bulgaria--where the Sci-Fi Channel makes its Saturday night original films--Man with the Screaming Brain is a curious mix of 50s B-movie horror body-switching comedy violent revenge flick and overdone slapstick with a touch of romantic reconciliation If that doesnt make sense well neither does Man with the Screaming Brain Campbell plays a pharmaceutical company CEO who visits Bulgaria with his estranged wife in an inexplicable attempt to invest in the former Communist countrys half-finished subway system The two fall in with a former KGB agent turned cab driver and all three ultimately meet their demise at the hands of a vengeful gypsy womanbr br A local scientist (Stacy Keach) and his goofy assistant (Ted Raimi) who have developed a technique to allow tissue transplants without the possibility of rejection steal the bodies and place a portion of the cab drivers brain into Campbells damaged skull Also they put his wifes brain into a robotic body they just happen to have at handbr br Campbell escapes and with a hastily-restitched skull and the voice of the cab driver--whose transplanted brain tissue controls the left side of his body--echoing in his head sets off to find and kill the gypsy (His robot wife does the same) br br But first theres an attempt to emulate Steve MartinLily Tomlins All of Me when Campbells two personalities battle for dominance over a restaurant dinner Just as he was playing his own evil hand in Evil Dead II Campbell is adept at making his body appear to be inhabited by more than one mindbr br At times Screaming comes closest to another Steve Martin film The Man with Two Brains as it also takes a silly approach to 50s sci-fi clichés However it tries too hard for too little result and that goes double for Ted Raimis semi-comprehensible Bulgarian oaf who gets entirely too much screen time (Nothing against Raimi its just that hes better in smaller doses) br br In the end its neither outrageous (or funny) enough to satisfy as a spoof nor is it serious enough to enjoy as a B-movie pastiche I was glad that Campbell had already left the screening by the time it ground to a halt as I feared having to say Gee Bruce that was reallysomethingbr br Perhaps the best praise I can give it as a film is that at least the images stuck to the emulsion And it was twice as good as Alien Apocalypse
Its so fake! The plot seems like a generic adaptation of the average blaxploitation film The common themes of blaxploitation like racism oppression and fighting for the integrity of your community are outlined so simplisticallyshallowly And the jokes arent even funny! Dolemite does these stand up monologue comedy routines that are really painful All the people around him deliver this canned laughter Even the soundtrack sounds like its fakin the funk For far better comedy in a blaxploitation try Coffy & Friday Foster with Pam Grier For a more realistic blax experience try Black Heat
I love the so-called blaxploitation films and have seen dozens Some such as COTTON COMES TO HARLEM SHAFT and HAMMER have excellent production values and are very entertaining while many others are very cheap and silly but still entertaining such as BROTHERHOOD OF DEATH or COFFEY However DOLEMITE manages something rare for the genre--its just cheap and silly and not the least bit entertaining! Its like blaxploitation made for very very stupid peoplebr br Years ago I saw a takeoff on the Dolemite films on Mad TV and unfortunately the real DOLEMITE isnt any better Like the parody the acting is just atrocious Rudy Ray Moore has all the charm and charisma of a piece of balsa wood He can barely read his lines and his karate is a joke--with his kicks obviously missing the target again and again As for the rest of the actors many might be even worse My favorite was the FBI guy who couldnt even remember his lines and really struggled to get them out--yet they didnt even bother to re-film these scenes! In fact so much of it was inept that I had a hard time figuring out whether the film was intended as a jokebr br If you think that despite horrible acting and action that there is something worth seeing about this film youre wrong Even for the perverts out there hoping to see some skin will be disappointed The naked women in the film really do look like hard-luck prostitutes and theres nothing remotely sexy about their sagging bodies I think looking at old people naked--REEEAALLY old people naked--is no worse than looking at these ladies And as for Rudy Ray he has man boobs No Black super-hero or anti-hero should look that bad naked!! For goodness sakes put on your clothes people and come up with a script that doesnt look like it was written by winos!!!br br FYI--Apparently there are actually sequels to this film!! I cant imagine watching them so youll just have to find someone else to review them I have watched PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE TEENAGERS FROM OUTER SPACE and ROBOT MONSTER but I just dont think I can bring myself to see another Dolemite film--they are that bad!
Dolemite is the touching story of Dolemite (Gotta love blaxploitation film titles) an ex-con who probably should still be in jail He gets in trouble with cops friends drug dealers women prostitutes and society in general Hes just not that likable a guy Neither is the movie though its still hilarious and worth watchingbr br The flimsy premise is that Dolemite (played with as much enthusiasm as star Rudy Ray Moore can muster) is in jail for a crime he claims he didnt commit When a drug hit or a drug bust or drug something is about to go down the warden releases him to stop it or help it or just watch it Not very clear All I know is that I was unaware that the justice system frees convicts in order to allow them to prove their own innocence My ignorance I guessbr br The plot is convoluted and unimportant basically Dolemite goes around killing people (Usually with very poorly choreographed karate) having sex and cursing out people sometimes even rhyming too The joys of the movie are its total incompetence and its total indifference in the matterbr br I stopped counting the number of times I saw the boom mike after it was in one scene for the entire duration (about two minutes of film) I stopped questioning why the warden was looking down at where Dolemite was sitting even after he stood up and walked around when they cut back to the establishing shot and Dolemite was inexplicably sitting down again I stopped wondering why Dolemite dressed like that when he got naked on the street to change because he didnt want to get in his car with the ugly (read: normal) clothes the jail gave him And I stopped wondering where he learned karate when he jiggles his hand on a guys stomach and somehow cuts him open The only time I was ever remotely nervous and tense was when the disgusting flabby white mayor is walking around totally naked with nothing but a towel hanging around his neck which just barely covers him up You keep saying Cut awaycut awaycut away but by the time they do you are already emotionally scarredbr br The movie is ridiculous in every way imaginable Moore as Dolemite is either funny cool or both If youre on the lookout for a bad movie you have found it with Dolemite
I was subjected to this terrible excuse for a made for TV movie I only watched it because I dont have cable and my only other choices were Golf College Basketball or local news The plot is very generic and has no substance that I could see not to mention it had a major flaw in my eyes The main character Dr Sorensen is a washed up astronomer who believes that an asteroid named Nemesis will strike Earth causing all life to cease He bases his belief on his discovery of cave paintings by an Aboriginee (Im sure I spelled that one wrong) The paintings show an apparent timeline showing significant events throughout history such as the building of the Great Wall of China All of the events are shown in perfect chronological order and the very last picture on the timeline is Earth being destroyed Now to me if the painting showed things that had indeed happened why would the great Doctor believe that he could somehow change what was going to happen? All that aside the movie moved along with extreme formulaic precision There was nothing in the movie that surprised me at all The actors were not very good and on a few occasions I just felt that they didnt even take the movie seriously to put forth enough effort to try to convince me that the characters were worth caring about The whole movie was cliche ridden and a downright waste of time and money Id recommend Armageddon over this piece of crap any day At least Armageddon has some good acting (compared to this) not to mention the eye candy that is Liv Tyler Now that I think about it Golf isnt that bad
This is better than the early Cronenberg horror films but nothing more than your basic what-is-real story The videogame theme has been told before too Nothing original is left except the weird Cronenberg atmosphere (which is not that strong here) with the amusing sexual references and Shores dark score The story never grabs your full attention It just flows forward event after event with boring pace Rating 410
OkulThe School is a result of a new trend in Turkish cinema Having used the same stories over and over again new generation directors finally come up with different ideas Of course it doesnt mean that they are all grand I think Okul is one of them It is supposed to be a scary movie but it is not It is not successful on being scary either So what is it? Actors are so average especially Deniz Akkaya is pretty annoying with the teacher role I am sure it could have been better if it was tried on harder Maybe concentrating on one topic such as making it scary or vice versa But directors have missed the target this time  out of 
I was not expecting a classic but at least a funny film There were only a few scenes that makes you laugh but nothing more You dont scare it is full of American teen-slasher cliches and you can guess what will happen easilybr br But it tells much about a senior student in a Turkish High-School Pressure of Student Selection Exam (OSS) that 3-hour-exam determines which university youll go and thinking about the exam when a ghost is after you is not exaggeration The movie is bad Dont waste your time to watch it
This short was director Del Lords last and only Shemp short The problem: It was quite weak and the cafe scene was pretty much a carbon copy of a Curly short Busy Buddies (1944) The interrogation scene was pretty funny and the beginning part of the cafe part But there are a lot of plotholes in this short For example why are the stooges hiding in the garbage can when the police come? In the remake Of Cash And Hash(1955) director Jules White fixes this and the reason for the stooges hiding in the garbage can is because there is a gunfight between the police and the armored car robbers The scene in which Moe is having trouble with the oyster was done before with Curly in Dutiful But Dumb (1941) The spooky house part wasnt all that great except for the hilarious scene on the outside of the spooky house To top it off the ending had no sting to it Rating: C-
Contains Spoilersbr br But if you werent dropped on the head as a child and then used as a football then youll agree with me that this is one of the worst and yet hilarious series ever made Centreing round a woman who as a young girl was beaten by her father who also killed her mother she spends her time drawing but wait for it then she becomes her superhero drawings and goes on to fight crime therefore being drawn by pain so clever The story itself is actually OK but its just how its done Jesse the writer and director has no idea how to write a script just listen to a monologue featuring the 8 year old version of the hero and it sounds like it was written by a 30 year old man while her dad who sports a great moustache just walks around the house all day while looking angry just showing how bad the characterisation is especially the bit where he gets angry in the first episode and begins repeating the phrase no more while holding his wifes head before killing her using the marble work surface The following bang sound effect and just his terrible acting as all he can convey is angry just is brilliant including after where he goes to beat his daughter using his belt which is all done with him moaning and looking angry in slow motion The episodes themselves could contain easily a good clean script ranging over 5 minutes but oh no Jesse doesnt want this Little Jesse is shitting out post modernism as if hed just eaten Donnie Darko and then douched himself to death Pointless camera jerks all at weird angles overly repeated lines and even pointless sequences just muddled up every now and again to fill the overlong episodes In conclusion the idea isnt bad its just how its done also there is a great character of a fat guy on a bench who doesnt come up enough and is great i just wanna hug his Lil chubby cheeks cause they look so soft The character development is non existent as the main character just says the first philosophical sounding thing that comes to her head although they all contradict one another But all in all mainly stbr br Indiana Jones 4 however is much better Type Jeeharv into you-tube as well the results may make you weep at the beauty of the world also youll hear a lot of cheap sex jokes mostly gay ones
First of all the genre of this movie isnt comedy its more of a dramabr br I had low expectations on the movie and still they didnt come up them As some of the other reviews point out there are some nice music in the movie But if you want to listen to good music I suggest spend the time looking at some concert recording with Bon Jovi or Mötley Crue itll be more quality timebr br Last if you want to watch a GOOD movie in this rocknroll genre I recommend Almost Famous
80s sleazy (glam)rock is like 90s house music or current boybands: its boring and has no ideas or ideals The only thing that makes it a bit cult nowadays is that its a long time ago so we can laugh at its sillyness Too bad Rock Star has no laughs at all as it must be one of the most boring movies of recent yearsbr br Chris (Mark Wahlberg) is singer of a Steel Dragon tribute band When hes kicked of the band at the same time the real Steel Dragon singer is kicked of as well he becomes the next lead singer You already know how this is gonna end up at that time with Chris losing it with sex drugs and r&r and forgetting about his long-time girlfriendmanager Emily (Jennifer Aniston)br br Theres way too much (boring) music in this standard formula-packed excuse for a movie and should be avoided for it at all cost Watch the (over-rated but still more fun) Almost Famous instead or even better a movie about real people playing real music having real emotions That Thing You Dobr br What a stinker 210
Wellhow and where do I start to describe this utter nonsense? Imagine the morals of a cheesy Hollywood Western throw in a lavish helping of the most trite soap opera storyline and try to dupe the kids into thinking its cool by dressing it up to be about something contemporary This film is all package and absolutely no substancebr br It starts with promiseyoung men dreaming of becoming rockstars and engaging in the kind of excessive hero-worship everyone can laugh at After that it all goes downhillquicker than a bobsleigh with no brakes The scene involving the first gig with Steel Dragon is one of the most pathetic pieces of cine kitsch I have seen in a long time The singer appears on stage for his debut and falls down some stairswill he get up and sing???or will he stay there on the floor and not singwho cares by now?? It gets worse but I dont want to bore myself by having to remember it in all its excruciating detail If you watch it after this review its your own fault!
This is the movie that is somewhat based on the exit of Rob Halford from British Metal Gods Judas Priest and how the band replaced him with Ripper Owens who used to front a Priest tribute band Originally titled Metal God this movie could have been something great Instead someone in an office somewhere who knows little to nothing about metal music decided to water it down From the title change of Metal God to the safe middle of the road Rock Star to the lame soundtrack this movie plays out badly Having spent most of my life in a professional metal band I was really looking forward to seeing this I was very let down by several points of the film The soundtrack is very NOT metal for one and the ending of the movie is lame as well The movie does have a few bright spots in the writing and acting but as a whole it fails in the end because1)A movie based on a metal band should have a metal soundtrack 2)There is NOTHING metal about Marky Mark or Jennifer Aniston If Bon Jovi Warrant Def Leppard and Poison are your idea of heavy metal go see this movie If Iron Maiden Judas Priest Dio & Black Sabbath are your idea of metal see this movie for a good laugh
I dont know any idiotic rocknroll cliché not used in this movie Ouffcourz  rock enroll life is only sex drugs and parties and tons of supermodels trying to ride with you Say it to stupid young boys The filmmakers seemed to have read too much GunsnRoses or Motley Crue stories I have seen everyday life of usual rock band closely and there are nothing to do with reality in this movie If you are successful enough your life is touring touring touring Its means that you are mostly in a bus and trying to sleep Just sleep Because you must be fresh sober and clean in evenings After live you have a little time to discharge your stage excitement Then you have a bit time to have fun But its not any luxury or dream Artistically this film was zero Stupid characters and idiotic dialogs The ending of movie was funny -- main character left heavy metal band and formed a grunge band! Yeah what a moral Real 90s
No emotion Bad music (and I am a reformed eighties metal guy so I would be vulnerable to some good stuff) Everything is half done The brother is a parody there is nothing to hold us in except to see what horror from the eighties theyll pull up next The tour manager tries to bring a humanity to the thing but isnt given enough time Wahlberg is okay and Aniston is slumming We know she didnt need the money Is this the only role she could fit into her summer break? Surely she must slap her forehead every time it pops up on VH1--which is only slightly less often than Ozzy does It barely qualifies as a TV movie Its just hard to believe that it was actually released theatrically
Here is another great film critics will love The problem is that it is not a very good moviebr br The films premise is simple Nine convicts escape a prison after the tenth one goes crazy and tells them where the treasure isbr br The first half has a lot of slapstick some of it very broad while the second half is a character driven descent into fantasy and melancholybr br The two halves simply dont mix Individual scenes do work very well (The guys crashing a friends house who has a new Filipino bride is hilarious While a later scene with the big guy working in the restaurant tugs at the heartstrings) They simply dont mesh with each otherbr br The movie as well is missing entire set-ups One scene shows the guys desperately looking for change under a deserted vending machine to buy a snack The very next scene has the whole crew in drag sitting down in a restaurant Where did they get the dresses and wigs? (The crew includes both the big guy and a midget) How did they get all the clothes and money to buy the meal? And most puzzling is why are they in drag? They are clearly guys in drag and lets face it is there anything more memorable to witnesses than a big guy and a dwarf eating a meal dressed as women? I mention the big guy and the dwarf because besides the old guy everyone else seems to blend into each other (In fact they wear matching white jumpsuits throughout most of the movie) The movie has very little character development in the first half and as a result the second half really lacks an emotional punch As we are often trying to figure out who is who in their individual payoff scenesbr br Speaking of a drag the second half has all those wonderful sweeping camera shots and big emotional moments and great symbolism that makes a great film It is also excruciatingly slow which makes for a boring moviebr br 9 Souls is a big disappointment the reviews gush about a great film and its in there somewhere good luck finding it yourself
The idea of nine stupid prisoners escaping and going on a road trip sounds pretty good for a movie Especially because its meant to be funny and I guess heart-warming in some weird way The problem is the movie was very rarely funny and often just seemed pointless and needlessly gross It was as if jokes or interesting scenes were being set up again and again but no one bothered finishing any of them--there was just no payoff Also the movie was just brainless and had the crooks meandering across Japan even though they left so many crime victims alive that its impossible to believe they wouldnt have been caught almost immediately--especially since they continued to keep using the same stolen camper for days on end And as far as being gross goes I just didnt need to see scene after scene after scene of guys peeing along the side of the road Plus believe it or not there is a scene where four of the guys are out raping sheep!br br All in all I really hated this movie And its a shame as I almost always love Japanese films--just not poorly made and uninteresting ones like this one
Critics love this movie I personally found it senseless and tasteless This is the millionth time Ive fallen into the critics love it trap and came out wishing someone would throw boiling hot water on my testicles because it was less painful than watching the movie There are many scenes that are completely unnecessary A warning to Animal lovers: Dont see this movie if you dont want to see sheep killed and molestedbr br If you want to see a good Asian film see Afrika If you want to see a film about escaped convicts see the Gene WilderRichard Pryor classic Stir Crazy Avoid 9 Souls like the plague
You have to acknowledge Ciminos contribution to cinema He gave us both the most over-rated film in history (The Deer Hunter) and the worst film in history (Heavens Gate) And before you start with the Its bad but not the worst ever let me explain br br For 20+ years I listened to the critics and avoided Heavens Gate-actually this was not hard because you are hardly bombarded with opportunities to view this film Then a few days after seeing the Final Cut: The Making and Unmaking of Heavens Gate documentary I stumbled on a used $999 DVD of the long version My advice after 229 minutes is to seek out the most negative review ever written about this film (you will find a wide selection) and imagine that the reviewer is Ciminos devoted mother and that she is doing everything she can to put a positive slant on her dear sons movie Then you will have an idea of just how big a mess Cimino madebr br While pretty much everything is wrong with this film what ultimately tips the scale to make it the worse ever (and a classic less than zero example) is its shameless distortion of history Although the cattlemens association did send a group of regulatorsgunmen to Johnson County and did have a list of targeted names the actual facts of an interesting historical event are hopelessly exaggerated On the morning of April 9 1892 Nick Ray and Nate Champion were besieged and eventually killed by an army of about 50 cattlemen and Texas hired guns who had come to Johnson County to clean out rustlers The citizens of the county then besieged the regulators who finally were arrested (or rescued) by the Army Women did not actively participate in the fighting and aside from Ray and Champion there were minimal casualties After all these were sieges not assaults-and there were not wagons of immigrants riding in circles around the encampment of regulations (early westerns to the contrary this was a film making device and not an actual tactic of the Indians) And weeks prior to the arrival of the regulators a number of Johnson County residents were hanged without trial including Jim Averell the keeper of a modest road ranch and his wife Ella Watson (who Cimino resurrects as his two leads and he even shows Averell living to a ripe old age) br br There is no movie-making sin greater than fictionalizing history if you are going to play fast and loose with historical facts then change the names and locations to protect the unsuspecting audience members who might go away from a film believing what they saw actually happened Fortunately so few people saw this film that the damage was minimal Perhaps it is harsh to blame Cimino for his distortion of history He could probably escape blame anyway with an insanity defense-the film provides plenty of support If Cimino was insane during the production of Heavens Gate it would explain a lot of things But my vote goes to lack of directing talent instead of insanitybr br There are some good things about Heavens Gate You can actually see on the screen where some of the huge budget went; expensive sets-beautiful epic camera shots-artful dance sequences Isabelle Huppert (a strange casting choice that actually worked) gives an agreeable and likable performance although most of her scenes are extremely boring (that tends to happen when the director forgets to give the viewer any reason to care about the characters) The dialogue is generally solid if rather ordinarybr br But dont fall for the crap that this film experiments with storytelling by intermixing carefully crafted moments of character interaction with textured pageant-like explosions of communal action This implies that there was a method to Cimino madness Experiments is another word for when a filmmaker gets so lost in his project that a coherent story is no longer possible The simple fact is that there is no evidence Cimino storyboarded a single scene or made any attempt at control or organization What it looks like is that he just turned his DP loose to stage action and to get an endless selection of colorful shots-15 million feet of loosely staged scenes Then he tried (without success) to pare this down and fit everything together in post-production br br The final battle scene is genuinely hilarious as babushka wearing townswomen (perhaps borrowed from a Fiddler On The Roof touring company) throw countless sticks of dynamite at the regulators Unfortunately each explosive falls just short of the target and explodes harmlessly After you see this happen 50-60 times you can relate to the woman (the one who looks like something out of The Grapes of Wrath) who puts a huge gun in her mouth and pulls the trigger This is probably what Ciminos mother did after writing that reviewbr br So believe what you have been hearing about this film since 1980 It is a sloppy disconnected poorly paced and historically distorted mess Of value only as a how not to make a film example for film historians and as a source of amusement to those knowledgeable about the actual history of the American west
I watched this last nite with an open mind Sorry to say it is still bad first the movie is too noisey and you cant hear what people are saying The accents are bad especially Richard Masur What is the French chick doing in this film ??? Miscasting at its worst Walkens makeup is strange The Harvard scene is useless and not needed Kristofersons character is unlikeable and I wanted him to get killed and go away Meanwhile the Walken character gets killed too early and easily ( despite the makeup) The settlers are all stupid GET ORGANIZED you bunch of hicks people are coming to kill you !!!!! John Hurts character provides some humor buts thats allbr br I have nothing good to say about this excessive piece of crap The only good thing is it ruined the directors career and killed United Artistsbr br Still Crap after all these years
I have just recently seen Heavens Gate After i watched this 3 hr 40 min epic western thats not a western i read the book by Steven Bach After considering all events and the movie itself i still think this movie is a complete waste of time I believe that when someone tells you to watch it they are in fact trying to bore you to death If for some reason you can enjoy this self indulgent over thought truely bad movie i have to ask why Though this isnt a reason to hate it it is historically way off It pretends to be about a situation that happened in Wyoming called the Johnson County War Simply the cattle barrons of the time wanted to kill all cattle thieves and claimed they were all immagrants You find that you simply do not care about these people and hope they all get killed because at least then something would happen Everybody in the movie talks about things that happen and it is never shown After you sit though this giant waste of time you wonder how someone could actually make a 4 hr epic in which nothing happens Oh and by the way the Johnson County war was not a war it never happened The Johnson County war in fact was called that because it almost happened in actual fact 2 people died I cant warn you enough off this movie However if youre like me the the idea of watching a movie that ruined careers and put United Artists on the for sale lot sounds like an interesting case to study then by all means watch this terrible narsisistic movie with no sub-text and a lot of photography(which is lovely sometimes)
The film Heavens Gate was a good view although still tedious at over 4 hours But the film took great license - as usual with Hollywood James Averill (Chris Christopherson) and Elle were actually married in real life Their main contribution to the Johnson County war was to start it by being hanged Well by starting it I mean it came at the beginning not the end Heres the real scenario: James Averill and Ellen Watson were secretly married because one homestead could be given to each family By filing as single individuals they could get two homesteads They chose homesites on Crazy Woman Creek actually controlling the water above the land held by a powerful member of the Cattlemans Association He offered to buy them out repeatedly which they refusedbr br Although characterized in real life as the owner of a brothel (Cattle Kate) and a prostitute herself (and also in the film) there is no real evidence that was true It is known that she bought many head of sick cattle nursed them back to life and was later accused by the Cattlemans Association of receiving the cattle in trade for lewd acts In the end she was accused of rustling - an act almost certainly untrue So much for this part of the myth of the American West which is a gooble-de-gook of myths spanning a time period of about one hundred yearsbr br In real life she and Jim Averill were surprised one day by several members of the Cattlemans Association taken in hand and promptly hanged Those perpetrating the injustice were never brought to trial But that was the first link that led to the murder of Nate Champion and the start of the Johnson County warbr br Quite different from the Hollywood version which shows her shot at the end br br Other than that I think the main problem with the film was the editor who could have made the action a faster pace by more skillful editing
The operative rule in the making of this film seems to have been never make a 1 minute scene when you can make it a 10 minute scene This was a principle set right from the start with an interminably long portrayal of the graduation of the Harvard class of 1870 The point of that scene I suppose was to introduce some of the primary figures in the story and give a bit of their background - which is somewhat effective when comparing the idealism of the Harvard graduation ceremony to the realism of life in Johnson County Wyoming but it just keeps going and going and that sets the stage for a film that features repeated stretches of mind-numbing nothingness made even worse by the fact that I found a significant amount of the dialogue to be almost incoherent In the end I couldnt even watch this in one sitting I got through about half of it and had to set it aside for a couple of days before I could drag myself back to see how it turned outbr br My reaction to this movie in many ways is a shame because there are positives here The performances are generally of a high calibre especially from Kris Kristofersson as Averill Christopher Walken as Champion and Isabelle Huppert as Ella The basic story - interspersed as it is around that ever-present mind-numbing nothingness - is potentially interesting focusing on the efforts of immigrants to establish themselves in Johnson County and a local cattle companys efforts to stop them by killing a number of them in collaboration with the government and the military Theres also some absolutely breathtaking scenery shots Having said that the whole thing could frankly have been done in half the time - and should have been In the end all those potential positives are washed out by - again - the mind-numbing nothingness that the movie seems to revolve around Seriously - 210
The director spent a lot of time making the scenes look real right down to the historical photos and all the sounds of the old west bustle Too bad the Producers and WriterDirector Michael Cimino spent zero time on any of the historical facts of what the Johnson County war was really about A lot of the war was over how public lands should be used for grazing The cattlemen didnt want the poor sheep herders on the land to compete for forage on this cold windswept plateau The entire epic makes no mention of grazing sheep which was one of the most important reasons for the warbr br The worst scene is the battle between the peasants and the hired killers The peasants are shown circling the gunmen like a bunch of Indians would do in much earlier Hollywood movies The true fact is that Johnson County Sheriff William (Red) Angus with a posse of 200 to 300 men intercepted the gunmen and trapped them in a barn at the TA ranch I doubt any women took part in the siege br br Ellen (Ella also known as Cattle Kate) Watson and her second husband James Averell were hanged by a lynch mob about three years before the Johnson County invasion Ella was never a prostitute This was a canard spread by the Wyoming Stock Growers Association (WSGA) in order to discredit her The fact that the plot makes her out to be a brothel madam only serves the interests of the WSGAbr br I object to the use of names of real people in a plot that is so obviously fiction There is no fact in the events time lines or backgrounds of the characters Why Michael Cimino would use real names of people who were loosely connected with the Johnson County war (and events leading up to it) is beyond mebr br The movie could have been much more interesting if it had dwelt on the political ramifications of the Federal Government intervention in a State Governments affairs and what happened after the WSGA gunmen were saved by the Calvary Some effort was made to prosecute the Cattlemen who were responsible by the Johnson County attorney But since Johnson county could not afford the court costs and the Governor of Wyoming Amos W Barber backed the WSGA the charges were eventually droppedbr br Overall I think the movie was just an excuse to show Isabelle Huppert naked for much of the three and 34 hours of running time on the DVD version
Now infamous Western that was (at its time) the biggest budgeted disaster in Hollywood history I was lucky enough to see the full 220 minute version at a theatre in 1990 It was truly staggering how BAD the film was!br br They had a great cast a story based on a true incident (a fight between foreigners and Americans in the 1800s) magnificent sceneryso what went wrong? Three words--director Michael Cimino He was so full of himself after The Deer Hunter he went out and made this god awful Western Hes not totally to blame His previous film The Deer Hunter was considered a masterpiece and United Artists gave him free reign to do anything They let him all aloneand everything went wrong The cost went barreling out of control and Cimino insisted on redoing sequences again and again until they were perfectbr br First off the sound is horrible Entire sequences go by and you cant make out a word the characters are saying For instance Jeff Bridges character is introduced during a dance sequence but I STILL have no idea who he was! The dialogue in his introductory scene is incomprehensible! Thats the directors fault--he should have made sure the dialogue could be heard Some scenes are shot with so much dust flying around you can barely make out whats going on The story line doesnt make a whole lot of sense and Cimino took great liberties with the facts--in the real story only one person was killed--Cimino turns it into a massacre There is some admittedly beautiful sequences here totally destroyed by lack of story and incomprehensible dialogue Also the bad sound was not the fault of the theatre--all the prints sound that waybr br This garbage effectively closed down United Artists and was the end of Ciminos career A textbook example of a director so full of himself he doesnt realize what hes doing Jeff Bridges has said this is the worst movie he ever did This is from a guy who made Tron! A definite must-missbr br There is a pretty good book called The Final Cut which details the whole disaster This gets a 1 I wish IMDb had negative numbers--this deserves it!
This is the movie that pretty much sounded the death knell for the auteur in Hollywood At over 40 million bucks Heavens Gate is so poorly conceived and executed it would take a lifetime to break down every area of failure What really galls me the most about it is that technically its very bad an unforgivable sin for the money that went into it John Hurts commencement speech at Harvard is inaudible as is a conversation between Kris Kristofferson and Richard Masur at the train station Some people seem to think Cimino intended this as a style He didnt Its just bad sound recording The characters are not particularly well-drawn except for the four or five leads; in the climactic battle scene its difficult to tell whos the bad guys and whos the good guys Even on that level its impossible to enjoy the movie The casting of Isabelle Huppert as the town madam is a joke her French accent renders the whole character a fraud The acting is generally stiff without any range or depth of feeling; even Christopher Walken is bad John Hurts character is the only one with any swagger or vitality (although Hurt in his 40s playing a fresh-faced Harvard grad with bags under his eyes is patently ridiculous) br br  I guess to say that its overlong is overkill The roller-skating sequence could have been easily cut the cockfight scene is rapidly becoming a movie cliche and the final scene on board the ocean liner is right out the Twilight Zone Having Rod Serling appear before the camera at the end to explain what we just watched would have been the perfect finale Actually those scenes in and of themselves are not bad but Cimino has not earned the right to include them because what hes given us as the meat of the picture IS so incompetently bad The editing is poor especially in the grand battle climax At one point the same explosion with the same wagon wheel flying from the blast is used three different times I wish could I say something- anything- nice about this movie: a great scene a great performance even one memorable line of dialogue but I cant It is all just one big unholy mess About the only thing I did like was the cinematography and the Montana locations which are stunning Even Cimino couldnt screw that up This is a long boring bad movie by all standards And the people who say that it gets bashed only because of the cost overruns are just kidding themselves 12  out of 4
Lets see What annoyed me most? The extra long dance scene in the beginning watching people twirling around so much I got dizzy Without even showing where the music was coming from All part of a college graduation that had nothing to do with the rest of the film Or perhaps it was the fact that each scene lasted about fifteen minutes longer than they had to What a drag this film is And the most annoying aspect is the bad guys are so bad so obviously horrible that it seems as if the director were making this film for second graders These people are bad These people are good Whenever a movie has its agenda-heart on its sleeve I am beside myself Theres a scene in a rollerskating rink that seems totally out of place Long drawn-out love scenes with the main character and a Russian prostitute that seems more like a rock star and his sexy groupie John Hurts character who is part of the overlong beginning scene drinks and disagrees with the overdone villains His death scene could very well be the stupidest in history And I hear everyone even the haters of this film talk about how gorgeous the cinematography is I think it looks washed-out Watch Days of Heaven if you want to see gorgeous backyards This movie is even worse than the anti- hype Its pointless The epilogue showing the main character in a yacht was almost as dumb as the prologue The battle scenes are tedious and dizzying This movie is really bad Avoid it unless you love bad movies because this is the king of them
The recent death of Stephen Bach one of the producers of HEAVENS GATE has raised the specter of at least a partial resurrection of the reputation of the cursed film Moreover the original release the long version was recently shown on TCM exposing the film in ail probability to its largest audience ever br br I saw the film when it first came out at a packed screening in a 3rd Avenue cinema across the street from Bloomingdales I think it was released on a Friday and withdrawn on the following Wednesday Maybe that wasnt a fair release but it was and is a terrible film Seeing the full-length version recently confirmed that judgment and with some thirty years more experience watching and writing about films I am better able to articulate whybr br First there is the dreaded phrase mise-en-scene whose definition is at the same time so simple yet so amorphous that it puzzles even after being defined Basically its everything that happens in front of a camera For example a crowd extra will be given a piece of action say just walking by on the sidewalk and a spot to start from When the assistant director yells action the extra will go through their action If theres another take the extra will return to the start spot and go again on action All of the extras do this Then say a cab drives up to the sidewalk and the star gets out and embraces another principal while all the while the crowd extras are doing their thing This is mise-en-scene In the theatre they call it blocking but cinema is far more multi-dimensionalbr br The importance of defining mise-en-scene is because when the French critics developed their theory of the auteur the opposite of an auteur was a métier-en-scene even more derogatorily referred to as a traffic cop An auteur was intimately involved in the meaning of a film and through the directors body of work a theme or themes discerned The metier-en-scene was basically a company man rendering in film what had been handed to him on paper It is the difference between say John Ford and Sam Woodbr br The second point is how the director Michael Cimino got into the position of directing films Cimino first gained prominence directing the first million-dollar TV commercial This depicted a Chevrolet floating down the Grand Canal in Venice This commercial never appears on any lists of greatest TV commercials of all time and is notable solely because of how expensive it was and how utterly exaggerated it was The effect is like that of a three year old girl brought out to entertain company who gets her biggest response when she flings her dress over her head Cute for a three year old embarrassing for a thirty year old So Cimino was praised early on for spending a huge amount of money for some over-the-top image and so he learnedbr br His first film THUNDERBOLT AND LIGHTFOOT (1974) has a scene where Clint Eastwood and Jeff Bridges are passengers in a lunatics car that drives back and forth back and forth until it drives off the road and the driver opens the trunk full of rabbits which he proceeds to shoot one by one I had the feeling that if the producer Eastwood hadnt stepped in that the scene would have lasted until every rabbit had been killedbr br Which brings us to HEAVENS GATE I guess if one watches the film on a DVD in snatches like a mini-series it can be impressive This is because scenes are directed with such a dense mise-en-scene that each scene is like an encyclopedia its just plain exhausting to sit through nearly four hours of this Its like sex at some point it just becomes a whipping There is the opening 40 minutes which takes place at Harvard Brilliantly photographed at Oxford it is something of a non-sequitur I personally favor the artistic way of unfolding a story as opposed to the more commercial _Now Im gonna tell you what Im gonna tell you of most films However the whole preface adds up to only one line- Kris Kristofferson and John Hurt went to Harvard together Now twenty years later All of that time money and effort not to mention all of the audiences attention and energy just to deliver this almost useless piece of informationbr br Then theres the scene in the street between Kristofferson and Masur which just goes on and on with a populated city of background extras and horse drawn vehicles in the background in continuous motion to deliver a tiny bit of expositional information Its just so exhausting There is just one scene after another like this Its like trying to eat a thirty- pound pizza Then there are these long conversations of inconsequential details and unintelligible witless dialogue which go on and on and are exhausting and boring br br Of course any single scene excerpted looks brilliant Overall its a rich piece to spin praiseworthy articles about Seen in snatches with the possibility of fast-forwarding through the boring bits or turning it off if feeling mise-en-scene whipped its basically painless But dont let anybody tell you its a good film When I saw it in 1980 there was a guy sitting in front of me who commented on the scene where Kris Kristofferson is on his horse and he turns one way and then the other and does this about six times Thats symbolic he said of he doesnt know which way to go That is basically at its kernel the basis of every pro- Heavens Gate critiquebr br Watch it if you must but be forewarned this is not a film whose time has come this is a stinker which will smell for all time br br HEAVENS GATE is historically inaccurate in the extreme I recommend the book BANDITTI OF THE PLAINS by Asa Mercer on the Johnson County War
I watched the 219 minute version and have to say that dollar-for-dollar it it probably one of the worst films ever Now I am NOT saying its THE worst film ever--but if you look at a ratio of cost over how much an average person would enjoy it this is a very very bad filmbr br I would say that the single biggest factor making this a bad film is the writerdirector Michael Cimino Rarely can so much blame be placed on a single person Had he not been so self-indulgent a film just as bad could have easily been made at about 90 minutes--saving the studio millions! br br The film begins with a completely unnecessary prologue thats supposed to be set at Harvard The scene is HUGE but completely without context You have no idea exactly what is occurring nor do you know why the students (in particular John Hurt) are behaving so boorishly I find it very hard to imagine a commencement going like this in 1870--and it looks a lot more like 1970 This is a half hour where you have no idea what is happening who the characters are or their motivations br br The next scene is 20 years later Inexplicably the two Harvard grads (Hurt and Kris Kristofferson) are in Wyoming So they went to the best school in America and now one is only a law man in the middle of no where and the other iswell what IS John Hurt in the film?!?! He just appears here and there and seems to be either a jerk (the prologue) or a pathetic and pointless drunk who hangs out with murderers--even though he is apparently against them!? His entire character made no sense They never explained why he was a Brit living in the middle of nowhere (it was impossible to hide his accent) why he bothered to come along with the hired army IF he was so against their wicked plan nor why he would risk his life for a cause he didnt believe in at all As for Kristofferson his excellent acting and better defined character made his character more believable though having him move to Wyoming AND risk his life for a prostitute made no sense at allbr br This brings up the worst aspect of HEAVENS GATE While the scenes are WAY TOO LONG and needed trimming the worst part of the film is that the characters were like cardboard John Hurt (a wonderful actor with nothing to do in the film) Jeff Bridges and many other big names are there but you have no idea why In fact other than Kristofferson Isabelle Huppert (as a hooker with a heart of gold--quite the cliché) and perhaps Christopher Walken EVERYONE is completely one-dimensional Its hard to imagine a movie THIS long where you dont know or understand the characters br br Much of the film also seems anachronistic Who would have thought to have a giant roller rink constructed in the middle of no where in 1890? I am sure that just getting the basic supplies in this region in the West would have been very very difficult--and yet we are expected to believe that trains filled with roller skates and lumber arrived instead of FOOD Maybe if they hadnt spent a bazillion dollars building and frequenting the roller rink the farmers could have afforded to BUY food and avoided this war over purloined cattle!!! And whats with the guy on roller skates with the fiddle? What did this have to do with a land war? br br The most obvious problem you are left with is that its a film where very very little actually happens until the big battle late in the film There are lots of scenes of filth and flat nothingness So much nothingness that by the time the battle occurs many audience members would have left or are now so hostile to the film that its inevitable that nothing could salvage the filmbr br As for the final battle it was done reasonably well but had problems First this minor skirmish on the prairie lasted longer than the D-Day invasion!! Second while details of the actual events of the so-called Johnson County War are a tad sketchy we do know that the characters played by Huppert and Kristofferson never actually were there as theyd both been hung BEFORE the battle Third I cant believe that Cimino actually killed animals throughout the film--especially during the final battle While I am far from a bleeding heart about animal rights his need to use animal guts and actually kill some of the horses is a low point in cinematic history Watching and knowing that some of the horses died to achieve Ciminos vision for the film is very sadbr br Finally after the big battle we have an epilogue While it is blessedly short it also seemed completely unnecessary and vague We see Kristofferson on a fancy yacht so we can assume that hes finally putting some of that Harvard education to work for himself We also see a woman who appears to be one that Kris looked at a couple times during the prologue Most importantly nothing is said and you have no idea what the final outcome I read up on it myself and found that the film often got the facts wrongbr br Overall to say the film is long and needed tons more editing was like saying WWII was a minor tiff Well Ive certainly seen a lot worse but if you factor in the cost of production I truly think it might just be one of the worst films in historybr br Finally when a film has this much explicit nudity I warn parents However as no child COULD sit through this film (even with a promise of sex) the warning is not necessary
It is unsettling seeing so many people giving outrageously high ratings to this film Some of the praise uses such twisted reasoning (and transparent agendas that betray a simple love of anything that is in any way critical of the US) that it approaches hysteriabr br Heavens Gate is a bad movie it is fundamentally awful Endless scenes using elaborate shots that serve no purpose muddy dialogue murky narative no sense of any theme aside from excessbr br The high rating of this disaster is a product of revisionist history and temporary shifts in perceptionbr br For some perspective watch Lawrence of Arabia before watching Heavens Gate You will see just how aimless and lost this film truly is The issues it may have been trying to deal with are lost in a miasmabr br I have no problem with films that are critical of the US per se but when a terrible film gets such undeserved praise purely because of that element thats worth challengingbr br The film is worth seeing for two reasons; curiosity and as a cautionary tale for young filmmakersbr br I saw this at home for free imagine the torture of being in a theater and sitting through it for 4 meandering hours!
Attention possible spoilersbr br This film is so lousy that it actually becomes funny The director has put in all the clichés that have ever plagued B-series movies The stupid bimbo (nice rack) getting caught again and again by the bad guys chief villain smirky and revealing his plots before they happen so they can be ruined and who of course bulliedkilled the heros father in an unclear past a side-kick in the person of a policeman - small bald and whose only preparation for the last battle (another cliché) is returning his baseball-cap rim-backwards etc br br The films end really tops it After the chief villain dies when the hero Paralised Stoneface Jack or whatever throws him from the roof of a building ten stories high they walk out of the building Which from the exteriors looks three stories high only and very much like your regular city hall br br When they exit the building the side-kick cant walk being that his right leg appears to be wounded How nobody can tell: ten minutes earlier he fell down shot in his shoulder and his feet were fine There is no further explanation for the inquisitive mind of the viewer who would be curious to know such trivial things as Where is the villains body which should lay near the building? and Why is there no police or even curious folks gathered round the said body? br br I could go on forever with the list Why does another one of the bad guys claim to have invented martial arts when he gets his ass kicked in no time? Why do bad guys in general make silly movements when attacking? Why does the hero look so faggy? Is there anyone really thinking yes these characters and this plot makes this a film to remember? And the actors suck Our hero and saviour of the day wears the same expression on his face The whole film That disgusted-trying to be cocky smirk must be some copyrighted feat of himbr br Also thinking that until now 12% of the people having rated this film gave it a 10 makes me full of fear inside They might have been serious and then were doomed
I think vampire movies (usually) are wicked Even if the film itself isnt all that good I still like it cos its got vampires in it But this stinks It really does give vampire movies a bad namebr br For a start the cheapness really shows Im not usually that bothered about low budget films - one of my favourite all-time movies is El Mariachi which only cost $7000 - but I hate this The actions a load of crap as well resorting to a stylish wobbling camera which gives you headachebr br Theres not much more to say other than dont watch this I bought it for £150 as it was an ex-rental and I feel cheated out of my money even for that low price
Don Wilson stars as Jack Cutter (Ooh real tough name!)a vampire slayer who goes up against a vampire army you see the story is a little different because vampires cant be killed with silver crosses or sunlight but rather through snapping their necks (How convenient as it cuts down on the budget) and its here Cutter runs into a reporter (Melanie Smith of Trancers III fame) Night Hunters action sequences shake for no reason during the fight sequences and although its meant to emphasize the mood it just makes the movie more jarring What is worse is that these fight sequences are botched beyond belief as Wilsons martial artistry is disguised by disjointed editing Of course the most interest comes from the fact that indeed this predates Blade however the problem is that this was done on a small budget and that it had Don Wilson in it Its from Roger Corman and basically this turkey is a movie most people would pay NOT to see I unfortunately am a bottom feeder and I cater to the section of the store looking for gems in this line of work you always run into turds With Night Hunter I just may have the worlds stinkiest turdbr br 12 out of 4-(Awful)
Pun intended This low budget actionhorror vehicle for Don Wilsons ability to kick things is the stuff direct-to-video fare is made ofbr br The plot: Wilson is a humorless vampire hunter who comes under fire from local law enforcement after he is forced to slaughter creatures of the night in view of the public Police chase him vampires chase him he responds by kickinga lotbr br There is a little more to the story but it is so inconsequential that I honestly cant remember it; I think people actually spoke in the movie but thats up to debate The plot is nothing more than a set-up for Wilson to kill as many vampires as possible in the running time usually by kicking thembr br The technical specs are in a word anemic Little color treating amateurish use of lighting simplistic use of camera and angle Blood and gore is noticeably limited odd for this type of film The most hurtful of the filming foul-ups is the jarring shift to super-shaky cam during each and every fight scene If the camera begins to bounce around like a reese monkey on speed then you know Don is about to start kicking everything in sightbr br All in all this is the kind of bad movie that can be made good with a few friends and a lot of cynical humor Otherwise do not watch unless you really like to watch things get kickedbr br 310
This is really a terrible film by any of the regular yardsticks Plot storyline acting effects direction - I could go on Suffice to say its poor However it has a certain appeal Many totally out of context sex scenes appear its fun looking for the Batman references Umm - thats it Poor really dont bother
You have to see this movie its a big footnote in the history of film When this film was made American film industry reached the bottom of sucking See this movie laugh and feel sorry for yourself for wasting the last 2 hours of your life Its the worst acting Ive seen and even worse directing The villains laugh like theyre taken from a clown circus and if the guys who did Scary Movie want to do a parody on superhero movies they only have to take the script from this movie and do a remake called Black Scorpion III: The threat of really really bad movies who in some way manages to lure the production companies into a sequel suicide
There is part of one sequence where some water rushes into the sunken plane everything else that happens in this movie is stock footage for Airport 77 You can even make out Jack Lemmon and Christopher Lee in some of the shots A total rip off? Well almost by definition There may be more stock footage in this film than in Plan 9 From Outer Spacebr br All the new material actors sitting around in an airplane set talking is bland and terrible on every level Dennis Weaver is totally wasted in a career low movie though thats true for everyone other than this films director Fred Olen Ray who uses one of this many necessary fake names in order to keep workingbr br There is a level of scant professionalism that makes this film such a waste of time it would actually be better if shot by someone with no technical knowledge at all because Ray has just enough knowledge about how to put together a scene in the worst old school TV fashion that this film like most of his films is totally devoid of life The worst kind of hack work The worst kind of film Boringbr br This type of film is a waste of money an affair where the crew on all levels are ghosts hoping to get whatever scant pay check they can and that no one will see or know they appeared participated in this rip off There are so many people who want to make movies its disgusting to see Ray burn up the money given to do nothing more but fill timebr br His commentary track is interesting in that he has to start it by explaining that he is really Fred Ray as he isnt credited on the film itself That tricked me into seeing it dont let it trick you
Submerged is definitely NOT the worst movie ever It does have its flaws such as borrowed footage crazy script and non-existent special effects (these are the worst) but it also has some good points too The acting is surprisingly good there are LOTS of familiar faces whom you probably know if ure a b-movie fan like mebr br I was very glad to see Brent Huff playing one of the heroes knowing him mostly for his 80s action films and i must admit he is not a bad actor at all Fred Williamson Maxwell Caulfield & Tim Thomerson get some limited screen time but are believable in their parts The eye-candies in this Fred Olen Ray movie are Yvette Nipar and Nicole Eggert both looking very sexy and very mean Michael Bailey Smith adds some muscle to the background as a Navy SEAL Unfortunately the only cast member who (in my opinion) is completely out of place is Coolio He doesnt act at all talks like he didnt even read the script and being a badass in the beginning of the movie gets shot like a wimp a hour later Not a good choicebr br To sum this movie up - this is not such a bad choice for late night entertainment If you can get over the special effects thing (so many guns so much fire and not a single wound on anyone) Coolios annoying performance and the recycled footage from Airport 77 you might like this no-brainer after all
This film has to rank down there with Ed Wood films A terrible script and bad bad actingbr br A machine gun fight in front of plate glass windows; minutes go by before anyone is hit and nobody has cover - not one window ever breaks Youd think after a fire fight like that the big U-Haul truck might be riddled - not a scratchbr br Do CIA agents and government contractors =shout= Top Secret information at a stand-up cocktail party with hundreds of people aroundbr br There isnt one actor you care about; everyone is shallow and basically unlikablebr br A Hawaii bound 747 flies out of Los Angeles and crashes twenty minutes later in the Pacific in 100 feet of water A short time passes when the stewardess announces to the five other passengers they only have two hours of air left; on a 747?br br The next day the rescue teams show-up and amazingly the six passengers are still alivebr br A movie that starts out mediocre and goes from bad to worsebr br 
This is a terrible movie that only gets worse and seems to never end The acting was bad the plot was worse and the special effects seemed to have been created by a 5th grade science class Dennis Weaver is such a great actor and should have never taken such a part My advise DONT WATCH THIS MOVIE!
Boring ridicules and stupid Submerged is a waste of time The shootouts were a joke real people do not just stand out in the open with out any cover hoping to get shot first! So many things wrong or bad not worth the effort to list except one major flaw At 500 mph for 20 minutes = about 166 miles west of LA and the water is 100ft deep??? Even at that none of the people would have survived the decompression from being subjected to 100ft of water pressure for more then 20 hours when they were brought up Just a awful
Okay I just had to sound off on this one Like a tremendous mental-gimp Ive just sat through this film in its entiretybr br Youll note that the trivia section of IMDB points out that portions of the raising of the 747 were borrowed from Airport 1977 This really doesnt scratch the surface Virtually all exterior shots of the plane skimming the ocean landing in sinking and even the at-rest shots are borrowed from Airport 77 All of the raising shots are pulled from 77 including most of the interior flooding clips with the exception of Dennis Weavers drowning I couldnt help but wonder if Olivia Dehavilland might come floating by at any moment or maybe a dead Tom Sullivan Another eye-roller: Dennis Weavers name in this film is Stevens which is to compensate for the fact that Airport 77s plane is owned by the Stevens Corporation (headed by Jimmie Stewart of course)br br This is a veritable calvalcade of actors who dont work much or at least havent worked in a while which might have been the first clue that it was going to be a real stinkerbr br Ive rated this film a 2 - Its quite worthy of a 1 but if this film cant offer any other redeeming quality at least somebody helped Coolio Max Caulfield Nicolle Eggert and Dennis Weaver make their car payments that month!
This movie was one of the worst I have ever seen (not including anything by or with Pauly Shore) I couldnt believe that a film could actually be THIS bad!br br Coolio has to be the single worst actor (again not including Pauly Shore) to ever star in a movie The temptation to hit the STOP button during this movie was huge (in fact if there was a THROW IN THE TRASH button on my VCR I would have been inclined to press that)br br Do yourself a favor and do something more interesting than watch this movie like watching the grass grow or watching golf on TV
Among the many accolades here for this production there was one individual whose comments asked if heshe were the only one (who wasnt that enthralled by it) - ie giving this film 3 stars However the comment went on to indicate an overall liking of the story and other production of same Well this person isnt the only one who didnt like this production (include me!) but there I part company even with himher If you put a gun to my head and asked me to make a choice between your shooting me or watching this flick again Id watch it certainly - but Id probably spend 10 seconds thinking about it Id much prefer being locked into solitary confinement or having to watch paint dry on a wall though Further I wouldnt want to see this story again anytime anywhere or in any alternative presentation Sometimes you feel like comedian George Gobels pair of brown shoes when the rest of the world is a tuxedo and this is one of those for me I liked Angela Lansbury in a favorite movie of mine Long Hot Summer and while not a huge fan of the show enjoyed Murder She Wrote But HERE -- I not only didnt care for the story or other aspects but I found Angelas squealing squawking singing and everything else about her over-the-top performance perhaps the MOST ANNOYING presence in any movie (or presentation in any other media) Ive ever experienced It was like an unending continuation of Audrey Hepburns equally over-the top Cockney chortling at Rex Harrison - in the earlier portions of My Fair Lady But that was incident to the plot presented for light comedic effect and (mercifully) brief Unmercifully this was anything but brief and to me seemed as if it had gone-on for about 10 hours (Einsteins laymans explanation of relativity at work) If I hadnt been with friends with the necessity to remain MY viewing would have been brief I laughed though at the Seinfeld episode where Elaine pisses everyone off because she tells them how much she disliked The English Patient My friends somewhat regarded me the same way when I interrupted their waxing ecstatically over this movie Give me some dragging fingernails loudly over a chalk board anytime instead
Some aspects of this production are good such as the performances of Angela Lansbury George Hearn Cris Groenendaal and Sal Mistretta But am I the only one who is distracted by the horrible performance by Betsy Joslyn as Johanna? She is terrible! She slauters the songs with her screechy voice and overacts in a role she clearly doesnt understand I also think the chorus isnt up to snuff They drag the tempo and make the worst facial expressions Overall I think this production is okay but Sweeney Todd can be so much more if done correctly This production doesnt come near the level this material demands The concert version with George Hearn and Patti LuPone is much better
I finally got hold of a DVD copy of this production and was agog with curiosity since I had read so many people praising it to the skies particularly Angela Lansburys portrayal of Mrs Lovett I saw the Tim Burton movie a few months ago and thought it over the top and overly bloody; thankfully this version is not so horrifying gory but it suffers dramatically in too many other ways for it to be in the least satisfying to mebr br To begin with the casting George Hearn is adequate and at least shows some expression (as opposed to Johnny Depps unending wooden face in the movie) Angela Lansbury is quite simply annoying At least she has enough power in her voice to get the point across as opposed to Helena Bonham Carters piping and expressionless little girls voice but subtlety seems to be only a word in the dictionary to Ms Lansbury One cannot be drawn into the story when one of the main characters spends her entire time mugging and winking in a look Ma Im acting! fashion and being far too aware of the audience This is not something that is typical of stage productions heaven knows--I have been a regular attendee of many productions at the Stratford Festial for many years and stage actors do NOT behave in that fashion as a rule (at least those who want to continue to find regular employment do not!)br br Betsy Joslyn Oh dear oh dear oh dear Did anybody besides me notice that she cant sing this role even vaguely appropriately? And her playing George Hearns daughter is just creepy considering that she was married to him at the time Isnt she supposed to be a sweet little sixteen-year-old? Yes I realize that this is what acting is all about but not once did she convince me that she was any younger than about thirty-five and the phrase mutton dressed as lamb seems to have been coined just for her Her butchering of Green Finch And Linnet Bird had me gnashing my teeth and ready to turn off the DVD player at once That song was done so well in Tim Burtons movie and this was a sad shock The song requires the vocal range of Julie Andrews in the 1960s and a purity of voice that is only comparable to that of a boy soprano Any vibrato at all kills it dead and Ms Joslyn spent the entire time warbling so hard that I thought she was about to fall off of her ladder because she was trembling so much from the effort at sustaining coloratura notes with a voice that is a mezzo at best Let us pass over the spectacle of her vibrating at least a quarter tone flat on at least three of the higher notes This is quite simply not a coloratura role and perhaps a discerning director should have told her that--but the fact that she was married to the star might possibly have tied the directors handsbr br Cris Groenendaal was adequate but again obviously far too old for the role and there is zero chemistry between him and Ms Joslyn which makes the whole subplot fall completely flat I am reminded a little of past stage productions of Wagners Ring cycle where due to the vocal power required for the singers to bellow over the sound of a full Wagnerian orchestra they would have to cast based upon ability to penetrate vocally as opposed to any appearance or acting ability or even a good voice which is why you have the caricature of the massive mountainous Viking-horned Brunehilde with a triple chin and a beard when the libretto calls for an ethereal beauty who is eternally young and bewitching The casting of the juvenile leads is exactly like that--if you close your eyes you can almost believe in Mr Groenendaals Anthony but as soon as you look at the screen the illusion is shattered (And at NO time can you ever believe in Ms Joslyns Johanna) For me the rest of the production was completely lost because of three out of the four major characters were so obviously miscast I cannot give a proper review of anything else because they were so distracting that they spoiled the rest of the production I really cant understand why people rave about this badly-shot and self-conscious filming of a stage play Surely theres more to camera work in the theatre than just plunking a camera down in the front row? If I want that Ill go to a decent play preferably at the Stratford Festival where at least they work together for the production and arent constantly mugging for the camera I give it three stars only because the quality of the production apart from the antics of Lansbury and Joslyn seems adequate if not spectacularbr br Probably the best thing one can do is buy the soundtrack of the film and a cast recording of this play and then combine the two to make a bearable whole Thats what Im going to do and try to forget that I ever bothered to rent this wholly unremarkable production
This movie moved much too slowly for my tasteThe concept of the story is refreshingly different in that it explores the family dynamics of living with a mentally-retarded family member in a way that I have not previously seen on-screenHoweverthe execution of the concept was flawedEach character was developed fully within the scene of her first appearancethen one had to endure the feeling that each character was treading water the rest of the wayThat iseach character flailed about awkwardly in her interpersonal relationships with others in the moviewhich I found to be a form of emotional and social retardationI suppose this has artistic meritgiven the irony that the story centers around an intellectually retarded individual surrounded by way above-average intelligence friends and familyThe actinghoweverwas well-done without exceptionI agree with other reviewers that the cinematography was beautifulIn summaryI think the film has strong artistic merit because of the fine acting and cinematographybut fails on an emotional level due to the shortcomings described
I wasted 35 minutes of my life on this turkey before I gave up The main character is completely clueless and astoundingly unsympathetic but there is no humor in his blundering As soon as he arrives in Germany the screenwriter pulls the old theres only one room in the hotel youll have to share a room with a pretty girl stunt Come on at least you could let them develop their relationship a bit first Watch It Happened One Night to see how to do it right--or any of a thousand movies since thenbr br The acting is consistently third-rate and the improvised dialogue should have been left on the cutting-room floor It meanders with no plan at all despite the fact that the film telegraphs the relationships destination from the moment Greta is introducedbr br The first song in the boardroom is mildly funny but badly sung The rest of the songs (well to be fair I only heard those in the first half-hour) are just pointless and awful Most of the singers are painfully out of tune but not in any intentionally humorous sort of way
Simply awful Im including a spoiler warning here only because of including a coupla jokes from the movie - there is nothing else to spoil as it is already rotten This dross was made during what must have been one of Sellers For A Few Dollars More periods when hed participate in any crap for a few bucks Id seen this as a 15-year- old high school student in 1972 and loathed it then No need to view it again; after 35 years I remember it now as one of the top five worst movies Id seen as a kid As I recall Sellers had more of an ongoing cameo role than a lead here but even his presence couldnt ameliorate the stale jokes lame plot and infantile repartee One ongoing theme revolves around Sellers use of his fingers: In one scene he holds up his open hand to a group of medicos and by folding down his fingers enumerates the groups for which a hospital exists - the interns the nurses the administrators etc - until only his middle finger is left up whereupon he says and the patients! Har Har In another scene to avoid costly lab tests he dips a finger into a urine sample and sticks it into his mouth to check for sugar then exhorts the interns gathered around him to do the same which they do He then advises them that hed placed his middle finger in the urine but sucked on the index finger and admonishes them to pay attention Hee Hee (The only reason that I remember this and this movie and am writing this review is that a friend told me an even dumber version of this joke today) If yu laik thiss you gonna luv dis movey If not see Hospital with George C Scott (came out the same year 1972) for some genuine marvelous black medical humor Better yet read The House of God by Samuel Shem and if you can see the movie version of it which has never been released (please make a copy and send it to me - Id love to finally see it)
Two things are always signs that youre going to be watching a bad movie :br br 1 ) If youre instantly reminded of other movies like THE TERMINATOR HARDWARE or BLADE RUNNER during the title sequence br br 2 ) If theres a death during a sex scene straight after the title sequencebr br Theres actually a third warning sign and thats a caption indicating lazy exposition warning the poor ignorant naive audience of the dangers of corporate greed  Guess what ? CYBORG 2 starts with a caption warning us of corporate greed in the future  followed by a title sequence that reminded me of THE TERMINATOR  HARDWARE and BLADE RUNNER followed by a death during a sex scene ! Hey you dont suppose Ill be watching a bad movie by any chance ? br br As you can guess this is a bad movie  Its basically a series of action scenes written around a thread bare plot of a cyborg on the run from a greedy corporate company  Its badly written  directed and acted and most especially its badly lit which means its very difficult to see whats happening on screen  though Im not entirely sure this is actually a bad thing  The only interest to be had is that its the film debut of Angelina Jolie who plays the cyborg on the run and who says the prophetic line  Theyre lovely  I wonder if theyre real ?  which is something I ask myself whenever I see one of her movies
Cybrog 2:Glass Shadow stars Elias Koteas as Colton Hicks (Rhymes with kicks!) a karate instructor who helps a Cash (Jolie) escape from Pinwheel her creators who look to detonate her and destroy a rival company Along the way Billy Drago and Karen Shepherd show up to displace the duo while Jack Palance is there to deliver guidance to the duo on the run One of the things that is quite shocking about the Cyborg franchise is how the series has managed to have quite prolific and off beat actors in the cast The original had Jean-Claude Van Damme and Dayle Haddon (Dont know her? Well she was in a bunch of 70s pornos) this one has Jack Palance Elias KoteasBilly Drago and Angelina Jolie The third one has William Katt Zach Galligan and Malcom McDowell (Okay so Cyborg 3s cast isnt that impressive) Ive never seen Cyborg 3 but I did see this on Sci-Fi channel and must admit I wasnt impressed Actually strike that Cyborg 2 is an often lovely looking movie its shot with excellent style and the visual detail make this easy on the eye However Cyborg 1 was the same way indeed the movie was directed with a certain amount of style slow motion and music that made it all easy on the eye Unfortunately like the first this one doesnt have any new ideas or anything resembling a plot or texture Most of the ideas are taken from Blade Runner and Max Headroom so for various reasons the movie doesnt have much to offer beyond its look Another aspect is the terrible acting Karen Shepherd and Billy Drago are absolutely terrible and Angelina Jolie isnt much better Elias Koteas and Jack Palance come off fine but seriously Palance is playing a cyborg warrior and Koteas is a karate instructor I guess on the positive side you cant accuse Michael Schroeder of not being ambitious with casting Still the movie is dull and I for one lost interest in the story fifteen minutes in Also why did they tie it in with Cyborg anyway? It has nothing to do with its predecessor which this manages to be worse thanbr br  out of 4-(Bad)
This movie is a cyborg in and of itself: half nonsensehalf Lifetime Original Moviebr br As a cyborg this movie has but one objective: to make you wish that you had spent the duration of the film in a dark room punching yourself in the testiclesbr br Unlike many people I did not rent this movie because of Angelina Jolie(Ill explain why I rented it shortly) I am not a big fan of Ms Jolies though I will say that her performance was stellar! Her blank stare and robotic acting really did have me believing that she was an android hooker If anyone has a clip of her on Inside the Actors Studio explaining how she prepared for this role please send it my way Ill make sure to use it when I try James Lipton for Crimes against Integritybr br So what drove me to rent this movie? One would think that it was the hope of seeing Angelina Jolies nipples but it wasnt No the reason behind this rental rested solely on one of the images on the cover of the DVD; that of Jack Palances face! HALF OF HIS FACE WAS ROBOTIC! When I saw that I imagined legions of Palances slowly marching through a fiery wasteland laying waste to any humans that were foolish enough to resist In my minds eye every member of this Unholy Army of Palances had a red glowing eye; a red glowing eye that looked at humans and saw only meat They were to be the Architects of Obliviona cold steely Apocalypsea Nightmare from which Humanity would never awaken Its a beautiful image that I will cherish till the end of my yearsbr br Like most things in my life the actual movie did not live up to my expectations No there was only one Jack Palance and the only visible cybernetic enhancements that he had were located on his legs Sadly those enhancements didnt really enhance anything That is unless you count WALKING LIKE A POLIO VICTIM as a super power At least their was a scene where Jack--grinning like a trigger-happy Alzheimers patient--got to shoot the hell out of some people I was waiting for him to yell Im damn tired of paying too much for prescription medication! Unfortunately any outbursts of geriatric rage were few and far betweenbr br What the movie did have an abundance of was a poorly developed love story about a man(Elias Koteas aka poor mans De Niro) and a cyborg(Angelina Jolie aka Demon Spawn of John Voigt) Oh man can the love between a Romeo of Flesh and a Juliet of Silicon ever be able to last?!?!?! It can if you follow Jack Palances simple advice: You have to TASTE each others TIMEbr br Yeah Im not sure what that means However I am sure that I do not want Jack Palance to be the one to explain it to me I sure as heck dont want him to show me! As an experiment I suggest that you ask your significant other if heshe thinks that we have reached a level in our relationship where we can begin to TASTE each others TIME?
As a sci-fi and casual Angelina Jolie fan I thought this obviously low-budget movie might be worth a look maybe it had a few scenes or a storyline that would make up for all its other faults Plus it might be interesting to watch Angelina as she was embarking on her star-bound careerbr br Oh how wrong I was One thing I learned -- at 18 Angelina Jolie couldnt act So to make her comfortable the producers cast this entire movie with people who couldnt act Seeing this Jack Palance (who can actually act) decided to overact Watching 10 minutes of this happen is enough to burn your eyes outbr br To the horrible acting and overacting add a nonsensical script insipid dialog bottom-of-the-barrel cinematography in fact add bottom-of-the-barrel everythingbr br The story features Angelina as a cyborg programmed by her corporate overlords as an assassin She escapes the corporate HQ with the help of her combat instructor The corporation sends bounty hunters after them Stupid stuff happens The end I would tell you more but I didnt want to waste my life watching this dreckbr br I implore you -- this is not worth watching Its not even worth thinking about watching Save yourself the pain and move on
Its a kinder gentler Cyborg movie with a love story Awww Its not as bad as it sounds The action when it is there is decent and Jack Palance Elias Koteas and Angelina Jolie are always dependable Its the fact that this is a sequel to the terrible Jean Claude Van Damme film or is that the capper to the Masters of the Universe trilogy? Im still confused about that Either way there was really no need for this movie What was there a need for? Angelina Jolie She may play an assassin robot that can explodes mid-coitus but what a way to go and even though this is her first movie she still has the presence that made her an award winner
I kind of had somewhat high expectations for this movie Ive always thought that Tom Sellecks lesser known movies (ie Runaway and Coma) where well above the ones he had more press for Maybe the producers should have had a little more knowledge about former major league baseball players who became stars overseas The majority were players too good for triple a baseball but not exactly major league matériel I admire the idea of putting Selless character in Japn versus the cliché of having play in the minors Sad to say this movie much like the title of the post is stranded at third by a movie that seems to be running on autopilot I wouldnt mind seeing a sequel and hopefully the producers would learn from the mistakes The premise is just way too unique to be left alone with this uneven flick
This movie stinks majorly The only reason I gave it a 3 was because the graphics were semi charming Its total disregard for a plot and the lack of even insubstantial surface character development made it seem like just a bunch of nice drawings This is by far THE worse anime that came out of Japan I cant believe they actually put their names on this garbage What a rip off selling this thing for $20 If you havent seen this dont bother If you have I pity you
Id have to agree with the previous reviewer: This film has awesome animation but has problems throughout the rest of the moviebr br Plot holes are huge dialog barely explains the concepts of the plot--the MAIN PLOT POINTS arent even fully explained until the last five minutes of the film The characters state the obvious while failing to explain the more confusing points of the film There are characters that pop up and have importance in the storyline that are never explained--most of them have names that are only mentioned once and it is exceedingly confusing to a viewerbr br Dont waste your time with this movie Unless you are in it for a good laugh and how DUMB it is
Its perfectly ok that people dies in an animation but there are just way too many death in this one Start from the very beginning the story is all around battles fights death and revenge It goes on and on for entire one and a half hour It was interesting at the beginning but I grew very tire after before the show was half way through Unlike other animations this one is lack of humor There are not many interactions between the characters either The good thing about it is the sword fight scene looks pretty good and the characters look nice
Well OK Ive seen Wrath of the Ninjabr br It isnt something that I would recommend to people who arent seriously into japanese fighting movies This is a sort of japanese fighting ninja movie with a complex plot Its about these 3 old ninja schools that had these 3 Swords of Sorcery I saw the subtitled version (NOT recommended by the way its easy to miss something) and I didnt really keep up with it all It had some good scenes tough but in general it wasnt much to my liking
Hard up No proper jobs going down at the pit why not rent your kids! DIY pimp story without the gratuitous sex scenes either hard core or soft core therefore reads like a public information film from the fifties give this a wide miss use a barge pole if you can
This ultra-low budget kitchen-sink yawn is the kind of film that can only be made in the UK in that anywhere else in the world the fact the a market would need to exist before a green-light would be given Most probably self funded this is clearly an attempt to redress important issues but ultimately undermines its point of existence in that the question needs to be begged who would ever put money into distributing this and secondly if a market audience doesnt exist to watch buy or rent this film why would anyone bother in the first place? My opinions may sound unfairly harsh on a first time director but this is the kind of film that only goes to undermine the commercial viability and quality standards which have only just kept a British film industry in existence Reviewed in Edinburgh 2 out of 10
First of all I just wanna say that Im a very big Naruto fan I love the Anime and the Manga stories Also the first movie just confirmed that Naruto is all about great fun great action great story  But then came the 2nd movie I was very hyped because the first movie turned out great But it didnt satisfy me one bit The story was lame action wasnt all that great especially compared to the Anime series same goes for the quality of animation I found it very poorly Could the story get any lamer ANY ??? Wheres the kyuubi of Naruto ?? Not once does he turn demon I mean  COME ON !!! My advice is see the series ( until episode 140  then its just fillers ) and then read the Manga because thats still great Ignore this movie and hope for something better in the futurebr br All and all I gave it a 4 just because its Naruto
I struggle to see the point of this movie It is supposed to be a comedy but I didnt laugh once The storyline is one that could have been interesting in a well made movie but since this is acted by comics the result is totally unbelievable (as comedies should be) The Comic strip series was very hit and miss even withing the episodes and it is fair to say all of the people involved have gone on to do greater things One to avoid I have also just found out that comments have to be 10 lines long The whole point of these comments is to give an indication of whether the movie is worth watching: not write an essay gushing about it or taking it apart If you like: Seinfeld Larry Sanders the Young Ones Alan Partridge Arrested Development Curb Red Dwarf then you might like to pass on this On the other hand if you like lame jokes such as can be found in Friends and Dodgeball enjoy watching this!
The Comic Strip featured actors from The Young Ones - a student based sitcom from the 80s Comic Strip features included parodies of westerns The famous 5 and The Professionals - all a lot funnier than this Having said that Alexei Sayle puts in a good turn as a traffic cop with ambition and the soundtrack features great music from the era 510
The basic story idea of ENCHANTED APRIL is excellent--two very unhappy wives meet and decide to pool their funds to rent an Italian villa for a month To further defray costs they get two other strangers to come along What makes it interesting are the relationships both before and during this vacation--in particular showing how this beautiful setting actually changes their outlooks on life Unfortunately this good idea is totally spoiled by two key performances in the ensemble cast that are so bad that they ruin the film Ann Harding plays the most important role in the film in a manner that makes her seem ridiculous Her doe-eyed expression and vacant stares really make you wonder if this isnt a zombie movie or shes just meant to be an idiot! And to make it worse Reginald Owen plays a character so obnoxious and bombastic that I was very close to turning off the film--he was that awful and unbelievable I noticed that at least one reviewer gave this movie a 10--which is very very difficult to understand Sure the film has great ambiance and a good plot but these two glaringly silly performances cannot be overlooked as they undermine the rest of the picture Sorry but this film was aching for a re-make!
The 1935 version of Enchanted April manages to be simultaneously tediousbr br and perfunctory It is difficult to show the transformative magic of Italy shooting in a studio with only stereotypical Italian behavior to belabor The transformation of the four strangers fleeing London is instantaneous in the cut from the first day to a week later Rather than develop the screenplay flips a switch and thebr br characters are differentbr br The husbands are boring enough in flashbacks without turning up even if their presence does not drive the four women back into their shells andor hostilitiesbr br Jessie Ralph has the most fun (moving instead of entirely chewing up thebr br scenery) and Katharine Alexander has some poignant charm out of herbr br husbands shadow (and away from his hideous droning) Ann Harding isbr br unremarkable here (with the Production Code being enforced) She had anbr br appropriate line in an earlier (pre-Code) movie When Ladies Meet: Yourebr br not worth a minute of one anxious hour that either one of us has given you but in Enchanted April can only look hurt rush out and proclaim fealty to her errant husband
I found this to be a tremendously disappointing version of a charming story I thought the acting was on the whole quite good Reginald Owen did chew the scenery as mentioned by others but I found him moderately amusing in his brief scenes TCM has made an Ann Harding fan of me and I thought she was fine as usual here Jessie Ralph had a field day as the old battleaxe ordering everybody around and Frank Morgan as always played Frank Morgan with a twinklebr br For me the problem was the script andor the editing--transitions were awkward motivations were murky The movie was just too darned short to convey the story properly! I felt completely let down particularly since I had such fond memories of the later version
Enchanted April was one of Harry Beaumonts last movies- he only directed a few more after this one He had made the Maisie movies in the 1930s and 1940s In the opening credits it says From the novel by Elizabeth and completely leaves off the authors last name rather odd but since it was von Armin they may not have wanted the German association at the time Sad to hear it was a flop when it was released with those fun names like Frank Morgan (the Wizard) and Jessie Ralph who played WC Fields disapproving mother- in- law in Bank Dick Two gals in London (Ann Harding & Katharine Alexander) decide to rent a castle to host two of their friends but things dont go the way they planned Reginald Owen plays the husband with multiple personalities Aside from a few funny moments it DOES move pretty slow Ralph is the only bright spot here as the overbearing take-charge type and the picture is quite fuzzy and out of focus for much of the film The views of Italy are all obvious backdrops The only saving grace here is that the Turner Classic version is only 66 minutes long Too bad they didnt give Frank Morgan a larger role This was remade in 1992 by the BBC as a British Film
I had been delighted to find that TCM was showing this as I love the 1992 version with Josie Lawrence Jim Broadbent Joan PlowrightThis film had a luminous Ann Harding a wonderful performance by Frank Morgan but others acting made the film more of a farce then the wonderful unfolding that the later film Reginald Owens Arbuthnot is painful to watch and you cant understand why his wife adores him I found out after watching the film that it was based on the stage play where the 1992 film is based on the book The original film also felt like it was a snippet of a larger piece and felt incomplete Too bad it was such a let-down
The final installment in the Karate Kid series is predictable poorly acted and so bad it borders on the enjoyable But not quite its just bad In this installment Ralph Macchios Karate Kid is absent already having been in one too many of the episodes The new Kid played by Hillary Swank is the teenage granddaughter of one of Mr Miyogis WWII buddies Her parents are recently deceased and her grandmother is unsuccessfully trying to raise this young hellion In steps Mr Miyogi to set things right True to formula there is a group of neo-Fascist bullies called the Alpha Troopers that must be put in their place and a new karate move called the Praying Mantis As I said before this movie is a mess and should be avoided
In 1984 The Karate Kid had some charm to it even if it was little more than a poor mans Rocky Alas producer Jerry Weintraub failed to realize it was best to leave the story at the point where it had ended and convinced Ralph Macchio and Pat Morita to make an extra effort to turn the film into a trilogy Part III was the definitive low in the franchise yet someone must have thought the series still had some potential What other explanation could there possibly be for the existence of The Next Karate Kid?br br Wait a minute Next? Yep Macchios gone (at least he was smart enough to stop eventually) and his replacement is Hilary Swank (!) playing a troubled teenager (what else?) named Julie Pierce Now the girl has family issues She also gets in trouble at school Said school has a sadistic gym teacher (Michael Ironside) As it turns out though one of his students is actually a nice guy and Julie falls for him This gets her in bigger trouble than before of course Lucky for her she is currently living with Mr Miyagi (Morita) an old friend of her grandfather who happens to know how to get back at the bad guysbr br All those factors ad up to seven clichés and thats just a generic plot summary - imagine what the detailed scenes must be like! From beginning to end The Next Karate Kid is a tired flat and dull marathon of idiotic lines and set-ups Swank does thankfully have the likes of Boys Dont Cry and Million Dollar Baby to redeem this disaster but why did Morita accept to come back? He may have received an Oscar nomination for the first movie and was quite enjoyable in the sequels but has nothing to speak for him here - even the revival of the wax on wax off gag is stillborn As for Ironside he is slightly better than Martin Kove and Thomas Ian Griffith in Part III but thats hardly a stretchbr br So is this picture really that awful? Not exactly There is one sequence that manages to achieve a weird beauty but when the best bit in the whole film involves a group of Asian monks dancing as they hear pop music for the first time in their lives it doesnt qualify as a recommendation to see the rest
They missed up the film when the tried to use some one diffrent They should of keeped Ralph Macchio as Danny instead of changing it And made more Karate Kids with him in itAnd also many people were woundering what happen to Danny when they jumped from 3 to 5 and no four
This film is so bad I mean who commissions this stuff? And the costume designer deserves an award for making everyone look like they had just stepped out of 1983 A bloke puts a female wig on and fightsnuff said
I am truly sad that this is the first bad review Ive ever made for a movieEVERI could stand to watch this movie and it is the second movie in all the movies Ive seen that is justa downgrade The first is Open Water that just had NO point whatsoever The Next Karate Kid didnt have any mention of Daniel(correct me if Im wrong please)and that ending line came as a shock It was like If must fightwin then it showed the bird flying around and the pan flute was playing and I was like oh Okay so itll take a while for this next part AND THEN THE CREDITS HIT THE SCREENbr br GEEZ MAN!! Hopefully I will never have to review a movie in a bad manner again I apologize for those of you who like The Next Karate Kid I really really do
I can accept the fact this was the NEXT karate kid so Ralph Macchio can be happily retired from the series and while Hillary Swank is great for the rolethe plot to the movie is just dreadfulbr br Mr Miyagis old buddy from World War 2 dies leaving his widow to take care of her rebellious grand-daughter when her parents die in an accident The girl has no discipline yet is the hero because the local ROTCwhich Ill explain in a minute has it out to get her You know the drillMiyagi takes her under his wing and in the end they beat the bad guys and everyone lives happily ever afterbr br Its hokey its cheesy its the 90sbut thats not even the long and the short of it My first case of huh? is why is there a military division in high school? I thought that stuff went out in the 1960s especially in a public school As much as Michael Ironside kicks booty in his role as the main heel since when is military involved in a high school? My next gripe is that during the prom scene the militants bungee jump to scare the crap out of peoplewhy? The thing I noticed throughout all 4 movies was at the very end the heels suddenly turn face after all the nonsense they put the main character through (Billy in part 1 Sato in part 2 Kreese in part 3) This movie is no different After Ned and cronies basically sabotage the senior prom blow up Erics car and threaten Hillary Swank the whole movieIronside tells them to beat her up and theyre like umno If youre gonna do pathetic face turns at least make sure the characters havent done anything too over the top such as blowing up a hot rodbr br As for the rest of the love plot between Eric and Hillary Swankcorny but nothing to melodramatic which is a breath of fresh air from the garbage Ralph Macchio pulled in the first 3 moviesbr br I will say for its own movie after watching the first 3 movies I can accept it being more or less a spin offbut I cant accept the whole military thing way too uncommon for it to be taken seriously Now if Ironside and crew was a wrestlingfootball team and he was the coach THAT would have been more believablebr br Ironside and Morita deliver the goods Swank is OKthe rest are the same as anything the one highlight is when they blow up the hot rod THAT was cool 4 out of 10
Hillary Swank is an unattractive piece of work in this unattractive piece of work of a film Pat Morita desperate for work any kind of work agreed to reprise his role as the Karate teacher and bring his brand of Karate to the silver screen once again except this time Hillary skank Swank is the studentbr br I can just see the Hollywood writers getting excited about the idea of having a tormented spoiled brat female take the role from Ralph The film does not work on any level and its boring on every level Theres nothing interesting here and not even a lesson for anyone to hold on to The film was made without any thought of making money because its just so badbr br I would gladly spit on all the actors in this film for having been involved with it and have the writers black-listed for their miserable and insulting efforts
The Next Karate Kid is a thoroughly predictable movie just like its predecessors Its predictability often results in a feeling of impatience on the viewers part who often wishes the story could move a little faster Despite its lulls and its extreme familiarity however this fourth entry in the series is painless almost exclusively because of the presence of Morita He doesnt seem tired of his role and he does inject some life and humor into the film becoming the best reason for you to see it Not awful but nothing much either
I had been avoiding this movie for sometimebecause I viewed it as an unneccesary installment to a series that should have only had 2 parts But after reading some fairly favorable reviewsfrom some IMDB watchersI spent $150 and rented it at my local video store Need I go furtherwhen I saythis was a buck-50 lost This movie is one of the 10 worst movies I have ever seen First offI realize that noone wanted to see a 33 year old Macchio in this filmBut why couldnt they have had Miyagi read a letter or something from Daniel-sanmaybe explaining what happened to Danielhell they could have at least made a quick mention of daniel or something But noand to compund the already bad scriptthey added those stupid monksI thought monks take a vow of silenceguess these yapping monks dont take their vows seriouslyhehehe The training the girl went through in the movie was hurried and stupidand the paramilitary group of young maleswere a confusing concept to say the leastthis was far from even being a martial arts moviewith the girl only fighting briefly in the final sceneand then she didnt even come close to getting hit even onceby the male fighting hergive me a breakshe would have gotten hit at least onceI guess the writers and directors thought it would be to shocking to see a girl get punched by a male in this one I could go on and onbut basicallyIll end by saying that this movie was just so badeven the girl they chose wasnt nice to even look at(she was sorta butch looking)I can only think of a handful of movies that I have sit throughthat compare to just how bad this flick wasDONT WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS ONE
I thought this movie was going to be a disgrace to the series After all part 3 didnt measure up to part 2 and this one doesnt have Daniel Sawn Miyagis humour wasnt quite as witty in this one as in part 3 but it was funny enough to make the movie worth watchingbr br The girls part was pretty good Shes a lost teenager who needs direction I find the plot a little hard to believe That the aunt would simply agree to leave her home and her niece under the care of Mr Miyagi a man she just met Of course he was a friend of her brotherbr br I did appreciate the monastery One might think from some of my other reviews that I wouldnt have liked the dancing monks but I thought it was amusing It showed that they know how to have some fun Now if these were monks in ancient China dancing to pop-music that would have been another matterbr br Probably the most intelligent part of the movie was when the girl thought it was stupid that the monks wouldnt kill a bug Miyagi told her that street gangs killing each other is stupid nations trying to destroy each other is stupid but having respect for all life is not stupid Miyagi has expressed such wisdom in the other films as wellbr br I give this movie a 4 out of 10 Sure there were some things I liked about it It wasnt as funny as part three and no character could ever live up to Sato in part 2 This movie has no re-watch value I cant imagine watching it again but it is worth seeing once
Young spinster who doesnt associate with women her own age and is eyed by gentleman from the retirement set invites an apparently mute young man into her apartment on a rainy day Nervous and overly-polite to hide her own sexual insecurities she is most pleased when the boy makes himself to home in her guest bedroombut not so happy when he begins sneaking out the window at night Sandy Dennis is not a hapless actress but why she was attracted to these sad-sack roles I guess well never know Based on a book by Richard Miles and about as far removed from a commercial drama as one could get this lurid material not only attracted Dennis but also director Robert Altman (whose work is static at best) The narrative seems almost a sex-reversal of The Collector a tag which may have sold the film-rights but which doesnt turn out to be a good idea cinematically Even the films best sequence (Dennis shopping for a prostitute to satisfy her prisoner) doesnt quite come off with Sandy acting both ill and indignant (whose idea was this plan?) Michael Burns is quite good as the kid who uses this frumpy pasty-sick woman just for her comfy digs but hes handled too bashfully by Altman with lots of strategically-placed towels and flesh-colored undies (Altman clearly wasnt ready for a mature picture with adult themes at this point) Sandy Dennis has a handful of very good scenes; she doesnt chatter away mindlessly here she thinks before she speaks and shes alarmingly careful in her actions Unfortunately the role itself is a bummer with an apparent slide into mental deterioration which seems to happen off-screen As such the abrupt finale is maddening and the overall results tepid 12 from 
The screenplay is the worst part of this film as it lurches from one premise to the next missing all the important bits that would have made a number of different stories possible (This film is confusing because the audience doesnt know what the story is) I had no problem with the low-production values and the acting wasnt great but this is telly so it was fine I dont mind if some scenes looked like they were done in one take But having such a non-sensical screenplay is completely unnecessary Did any executive actually read it before forking out the cash? Avoid this at all costsbr br The prologue in particular was so poorly written it needed a voice-over to fill in all the details that had been left out The prologue was rushed it wasnt clear what was happening ie The Russian Revolution was reduced to Some riots are happening in Petersburg with the next scene being soldiers arresting them I know the basic history of the Revolution so I could fill in the details those pesky Communists The prologue is best ignoredbr br This could have been a thoughtful study of a person who is confused about who she is It sets up this premise in the asylum It could then have her struggling to identify herself for the rest of the film No Gone The film assumes she is who she says she is (even though there is still no empirical evidence) It sets up a melodramatic romance a love so strong itll believe anything she says Okay a soppy romance No because it makes no sense The love interest seems like a crazed (and incidentally sleazy) lunatic bursting out in wild gestures This also doesnt work because the film stupidly decides to tell the truth in the monologue at the end They never got married and she returned to America The love story collapses Despite there being plenty of love scenes I was never convinced of the reason that they were in love I find rom-com romances more convincing despite there only being one or two scenes which establish that theyve even spent any time with each otherbr br It could have been a thriller-type thing where the film assumes she is who she says she is and she struggles to prove her identity No the court case is summed up rather than dealt with The bizarre voice over comes back again to fill in the details of a better filmbr br The funniest thing to consider is what really happened Anna Anderson was a loony who went to America and married another loony and they did crazy things together Throughout her life she had bouts of lunatic behaviour None of this in the film either Theres a really annoying character in the asylum who crops up from nowhere and announces herself as a One Flew Over the Cuckoos NextTwelve Monkeys-type informant Thankfully she vanishes having brought nothing to the story
The Man with Bogarts Face sets it self up to mine the viewers nostalgia for the late 30s-late 40s film era It fails miserably for several reasons First Sacchi while looking reasonably like Bogart and even speaking like him on occassion and using his mannerisms completely lacks any of Bogarts charisma or acting ability This is really apparent whenever Sacchi is not clearly imitating a scene from one of Bogarts films Second the film does not have the first rate character actors Bogart was able to work with There are no Peter Lorres or Sydney Greenstreets in this one folks Sure we are treated to performances by Victor Buaeno Olivia Hussey and George Raft amongst others but they just arent of the same caliber (or arent given enough screen time or are miscast) Third the attempts at modern humor all fall through All of the underwear jokes having Marlowe almost never remove that damn hat and trench coat (even though Bogart would have) etc just arent funny and really pull down this film Fourth Ive never heard a goofier theme song this side of Mitchell Finally the films false reverence for Bogart (and other classic actors work) is truly irritating Bogart almost never played a straight hero on those occasions he was a hero He played complicated characters This movie makes Bogart out to be a trigger-happy moralistic do-gooder While this may have been true about some film characters Bogarts characters rarely fit that bill Its movies like this that make people unexposed to the cinema of the past think that all of it is hokey good guy beats the bad guys and gets the girl crap with low production values
This movie should have been called The Eyes of Alexander and they should have done away with the Bogart concept altogether The film started out with a lighthearted approach to Bogarts legacy and some comical moments with his surgery oriented face but after the first 15-30 minutes it morphs into a more serious thriller where two palm size sapphires purportedly laid as eyes into a marble headpiece of Alexander the Great for him and seen by him right before his death So the gems are of great value not only because of their quality and size but also because of the tie to the Greatest conquerer the world has ever known Being an expert on Alexander qualifies me to say that this is wholly and completely a fiction but it makes for a good movie anyway So the film winds around some early silliness and stumbles along with all sorts of Alexander allusions in both the foreground and background (which I really liked) ending with a dated shark attack (you couldnt go to a movie in 79-80 without some shark showing up to menace the audience) There is a yacht named Euridice (Alexanders fathers young wife) a man named Alexander Philip Cleitus? (its been about 5 years since Ive seen the film so cant remember all the details) Olympias some street names and many others It was fun to watch the film just to try to catch all the background details that the director (obviously an Alexanderphile himself) put in When all is said and done the eyes are retrieved and the camera pans in on them on a bed as the credits roll by Kind of a neat ending What would have been more fun would be if they went the Indiana Jones way and had an action adventure There were many many real artifacts that could have been used to make this more interesting or instance the hand-annotated (by Aristotle) version of the Iliad that Alexander kept with him all his life even on his many journeys across Asia (would be of incalculable value if found today) Olivia Hussey (my all time favorite b-movie actress)is killed off way too early and should have been the main actress throughout not the girl from the Mommas and the Poppasthough she was herself easy on the eyes If you can find this flick it might be worth checking out for the historical stuff and to see Olivia Hussey in an extremely funny deadpan humor bit early on but beyond that Id pass on it for something more entertainingbr br Yours Nick

Committed doom and gloomer Peter Watkins goes slummin across the pond to take on the American justice system circa 1971 with this priceless piece of zeitgeist paranoia that leans so far left it falls over constantly Watkins is pure tourist as he assembles this our gang tragedy with cliché freaks hippies and black revolutionaries pitted against trigger happy cops and military and a kangaroo court tribunal made up of disapproving calcified adults making poor fashion statements Talk about a revolutionbr br In Punishment Park we have radical youth versus corrupt system as dissenters convicted of crimes are given the choice of imprisonment or a three day trek across Punishment Park (Death Valley) and freedom Of course the law enforcement officials monitoring their journey arent about to play fair and combined with the stifling heat the fate of our protagonists looks sealedbr br Punishment Park has elements of Kafka in setting as well as theme Trials are held under a large canvas tent where shackled prisoners shout defiance at a hardcore love it or leave it group of inquisitors (such as members of Silent Majority for a Peaceful America) who snarl back Neither group spends much time listening to the other and the proceedings sometime takes on a teen parent battle over the keys to the car look Mostly its just one side saying whats wrong with America the other saying whats right with no one offering solutions for change Meanwhile the Punishment Park martyrs stumble endlessly about the dessert while cops with guns act like twelve year olds It kind of has the look and feel of some of my 70s college film making class when we were younger and knew more then than we do nowbr br Peter Watkins has always been on the side of the underdog and the common man against what he perceives as a corrupt powerful few Culledon was a strong indictment of military atrocity in 18th century Scotland that still resonates War Game is a raw sobering look at nuclear aftermath that should be required viewing for all Punishment Park has its value as well but for other than intended reason Watkins vision today is a textbook example of the left in full tilt counter culture 70s paranoia and given the times ( Vietnam Kent State The Chicago 7) such strident hysteria seemed not that great a distance from the truth But 35 years later the fever has subsided and Punishment Park with its unrestrained narrow viewpoint is a pretty silly ride
I loved the first 15 minutes and I loved some of the dialogue in the tribunal--which proved to be the best showcase for the directors ahead-of-its-time method acting technique--but this movie ultimately disappoints Even when viewed purely as a metaphor of the oppressoroppressed dynamics that were and are prevalent in the relationship between the US government and its more disobedient citizens it still lacks punch and believability and ultimately left me looking at my watch hoping the obvious ending would happen alreadybr br And for the record: despite rampant rumors to the contrary this movie has never been banned in the US (I cant comment on the rumors of UK censorship but Im suspicious) Hollywood refused to distribute it after its initial film festival showing and I am more than willing to believe the Nixon government had some influence on this decision; however the fact that it never appeared on American television is merely a reflection of this mediums rather careful and advertising-driven fashion of doing business As for the present you can have your very own copy of the DVD delivered to your door via Amazon in a few days
The person making taffy in this movie was so realistic That person must have been trained so well! If I were buying taffy from the store featured in this fine romantic comedy I would demand to be served by the guy who trained the person who played the guy selling taffy
A really funny story idea with good actors but it misses somehow The actors are older but none of them looked particularly good They needed better make upphotography or somethingIt is supposed to be a love story and yet the film had more of the rough look of a street film I liked the cast but I think the performances were rather bland This is where the weakness of the director shows Perhaps if Mrs Spielberg had Mr Spielberg directing it would have been a much better film
I liked most of the dialogue I liked the cast I thought it was well acted I particularly enjoyed Ellen DeGeneres perfect deadpan performancebr br What didnt work for me was: (1) the drawn-out affair with the younger man (too long too seemingly out of character for Helen) (2) the seemingly endless cinematic cliches mostly visual but including interminable voiced over re-readings of the love letter itself (its contents should have a mystery); (3) a young woman feminist-scholar and ironically a fireworks scene (no wonder this reminded me of that horrid How to Make an American Quilt movie); (4) the bumbling gotcha cop who smells dope everywhere (no cliche there either!); and (5) a nauseatingly romanticized small town settingbr br I would have preferred the film to more persuasively explore the source of (or even glorify) Helens bitterness to have included much more of DeGeneres character to have eliminated or reduced the various intergenerational artifices and to be a little less uncritical of small town lifebr br Had it been developed as a play first those criticisms might have been addressed before committing the material to this film which unfortunately is decidedly mediocre
Dont waste your time The plot drags the characters are wooden and uninteresting the motivations of their actions are completely indecipherable Kept waiting for the romantic or comedy to occur and nothing happened Worse yet the love letter isnt even romantic but sounds like it was written by someone desperate to make a deadline Did I mention that the plot twist which we saw coming from 15 mins into the movie was Hollywood clever meaning it is intended to shock but given the Hollywood mentality- does nothing of the sort and instead is vaguely offensivebr br Its not even worth the $2 to rent Dont bother seeing it
Possible Spoilers	From Dreamworks and director Peter Chan The Love Letter is a romantic comedy that takes place in a picturesque New England coastal village where single mom Helen (Kate Capshaw) owns a quaint little bookstore One day at work Helen happens across an anonymous letter (the love letter of the title) that has somehow become lodged beneath the cushions of a reading couch Upon reading the amorous prose therein she believes it has been written to her purposely placed in the couch for her to find and for reasons of her own thinks she knows the identity of her secret admirer Inadvertently however Helen leaves the letter out where her employee Janet (Ellen DeGeneres) finds it believes it to be for her and of course thinks she knows who wrote it Circumstances then bring it into the possession of a young man named Johnny (Tom Everett Scott) who thinks Helen has written the letter to him And before it all gets sorted out you can only imagine the hilarious situations into which all of those involved have been cast; and I do mean imagine because the way this movie plays out the audience gets little more from it than what it brings along itself There are two specific areas in which this romantic comedy fails miserably: It simply isnt very romantic and its not funny; and that is a potent combination that causes this film to misfire practically from the opening credits Once the setting and main character (Helen) have been established it basically goes nowhere for the next ninety minutes or so By the time you finally find out who actually wrote the letter and to whom you could care less Rounding out the cast is Tom Selleck Blythe Danner Julianne Nicholson Gloria Stuart and Geraldine McEwan Its a shame to see such talent wasted on such claptrap as this and looking bad in the balance Kate Capshaw who usually brightens up the screen just by showing up looks tired here while Selleck appears to have just come in off a three day bender thats lasted a week Ellen DeGeneres actually comes away looking the best of the bunch It is said that the journey is often a more heady experience than the destination In the case of The Love Letter however it would have been best for all concerned if everybody had just stayed home in the first place I rate this one 110
A movie about a mysterious love letter that puts a small town on its ear should be fun romantic and easy-going entertainment Instead this movie is more about things not said and not expressed so it gets to the point where you are grateful anything is said at all even if the dialogue is not exactly quotable br br SPOILER --br br When the relationship that says the most is the one least seen on the screen (Danner and McEwan) you know youre in trouble But those two actresses are a very welcome sight in a movie screaming for some genuine peoplebr br END OF SPOILERbr br Capshaw is given the task of creating a character from not much and she is not entirely successful Like I said above the theme seems to be repression and I understand that is an element of life and love but I dont want to see a movie about it either at least not this one br br I cant recommend this at all despite the very talented cast who are left to fend for themselves
This is a movie about people receiving a love letter Nobody knows who sent in and nobody knows who it is for A good cast headed up by Kate Capshaw Tom Selleck and Ellen DeGeneres This however is a completely dopey plot As an example the Capshaw character one of the leading citizens of a small town in New England takes up with an immature college student who works in her bookstore during the summer She chooses him instead of Tom Selleck the town firefighter who is crazy about her If that isnt the epitome of stupidity I dont know what is Just an example of how dopey this movie is Watching Kate Capshaw jog is a pleasure but you immediately realize that she has never jogged a day in her life Another obviously dopey part of a dopey movie
The Love Letter is one of those movies that could have been really clever but they wasted it Focusing on a letter wreaking havoc in a small town the movie has an all-star cast with nothing to do Tom Selleck and Alice Drummond had so recently co-starred in the super-hilarious In & Out (also about an upset in a small town) in which they were both great but here they look as though theyre getting drug all over the place I cant tell what the people behind the camera are trying to do here (if anything) but they sure didnt accomplish anything How tragic that a potential laugh riot got so sorrowfully wasted
First of all Blythe Danner doesnt look anywhere NEAR old enough to play Capshaws daughter (and in fact she isnt -- only ten years apart)br br I understand this is supposed to be one of those magical Moonstruck type supernatural romances but this is beyond the pale Very very weak in terms of acting script and direction br br The only one who really shines here is Ellen DeGeneres who makes this film watchable -- if not really believable herself as shes cast as a bit of a heterosexual sex hound But endearing nonetheless Actually DeGeneres and the skin shots of the young guy Capshaw dallies with together make this watchable But no one can really tell if Capshaw is really in love with the young guy or not; neither the script nor her acting pull it together for us and were left to wonder how she really feels
This film is about a mysterious love letter that turned 4 peoples love life upside downbr br The idea of the film is interesting and the film could have been funny However this film is simply what a romantic comedy should not be The characters are inadequately introduced at first so it gets so confusing The supporting characters come and go without adequate reasons as if they exist just for one particular scene and then vanish into thin air The pacing is awfully slow that it makes 90 minutes seem more like 180 minutesbr br It could have been romantic and funny but this film spectacularly failed to do either
I must be honest I like romantic comedies but this was not what I had hoped for I thought Ellen Degeneres was having the biggest part which should have been because I didnt like the two struggling bed partners It was awful Poor Tom Selleck!! He had to act with someone who was that much in the picture while it should have been him and Ellen to be in most of the film They were the only believable ones And the only really funny parts starred them not Kate Capshaw and that Everett guy Cool that mummy is coming out of the closet I thought that was a nice surprise br br Im just glad I saw it on the cable and I didnt pay any money renting it
Divorced single mom in picturesque seaside town finds an anonymous love letter and allows it to spur into action her dormant love life Pet project for actressco-producer Kate Capshaw who gives a warm nicely-modulated lead performance yet this story is so slim and the direction and editing so erratic that a faint dissatisfaction creeps in Initially Capshaws Helen envisions several of her friends reading the love letter to her (an interesting visual joke) but the first person they do this ploy with is Ellen DeGeneres who doesnt play a lesbian but who comes off as one because of this gimmick Different ideas are flayed about in the hopes that one would stick and the continuity is extremely choppy Supporting cast (including Tom Selleck and Tom Everett Scott who mostly acts with his shirt off) is very good but they cant save the final act which is disappointing Low-keyed in a quirky pleasant way but it is blandly good-natured nothing more 12 from 
I am a huge Robert Taylor fan and I have been trying to find all of his films This is one I did not have but I watched it recently on Fox Movie Channel and was very disappointed I know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script Victor McLaglen was even bad and Brian DonLevy was almost unrecognizable Considering the relations off screen between Taylor and Stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them But the premise of the film was so ridiculous: that the President of the US would order a Navy Lt to leave the service secretly to hunt down bank robbers and report only to the President that it made it hard to appreciate anything else about the film The death row scenes were entirely unmoving The only thing worse than Taylors acting was Stanwycks singing She got better later in Ball of Fire-thank heavens
Dorothy Provine does the opposite here: She keeps growing and growing I didnt detect any subtext though The Incredible Shrinking Man and other movies of its ilk during the period were parables about radiation nuclear war and other horrors Provines growth is the result of an inept computerrobotbr br And who operates this computer but Lou Costello! I like some of his movies with Bud Abbott But though this is a pretty bad movie he does fine without him And Gale Green is an excellent foilbr br Green plays the pompous town big shot He is Provines father He is intent on being elected Mayor So when his beloved daughter starts having issues he dumps her He doesnt exactly dump her but gives up his battle against her longtime admirer Costellobr br This is pretty implausible: Costello is the local garbage collectorbr br The special effects are minimal And the subplot involving the military is lame in the extreme
May contain spoilers Sadly Lou Costellos last film has the distinction of being slightly better than Abbott & Costellos last movie together Dance With Me Henry This movie isnt all in all outright terrible it is an amusing career misfire Dorothy Provine is nice to look at and makes the movie somewhat bearable You cant blame Lou Costello for this because a major studio released it which meant somebody had to give it the green light In my opinion Lou Costello was getting over problems of his own losing his son a few years earlier and the unwarranted attacks from the IRS If you look at the last 3-4 Abbott & Costello movies you can notice the magic was gone Check out Dance With Me Henry now thats a painful movie to watch
Lou Costello (sans Abbott) plays a small town self-employed rubbish collector (and the inventor of a time-controlling machine!) who is secretly courting the niece of the town big-shot After a spat Lous girl (Dorothy Provine) runs into a misty cave--why its misty we never learn--and emerges as a 30 foot giant Provine is certainly a good sport and she doesnt bother trying not to look ridiculous (it wouldve been impossible anyway) yet the screenwriter is really cruel to this character turning her not only into a giant but a nagging harpy as well Provine bosses Costello around while creating havoc with the Army troops who get called in but nothing funny is done with the transformation Trumped by Attack of the 50 Ft Woman the previous year the film does feature Lou Costello in his final bow but provides little else The special effects are marginal while the script needed funnier lines and the direction snappier pacing 12 from 
OUR GANG got one chance at a feature film in its 22 year history and this was the best that could be done? Its boring forced and pointless and I must respectfully disagree with the other poster on this film; the 1994 LITTLE RASCALS remake was better than this Almost anything is The kids are subordinate to the Civil War proceedings; it doesnt feel like an OUR GANG film at all but like a humorless second-rate Shirley Temple clone
Though the Our Gang comedies still have their followers Ive got to say that their attempt to graduate to feature films courtesy of Hal Roach came up way short Why did Roach have to pick the Civil War as is subject with all the attendant racism that would followbr br Dashing southern cavalier Phillips Holmes takes in young orphan Spanky McFarland and his young black friend Buckwheat Thomas after Spanky inadvertently exposes a card cheat on a riverboat All is placid and serene in the Old South and then the Civil War comes to ruin it for everybodybr br But even children can charm the worst in the world and theres none worse than those damn Yankees They just come south and ruin it for everybodybr br Criticized though it was for its southern viewpoint Gone With The Wind did make a good case for the southern cause and the blacks portrayed even though servile which they would be out of necessity are still three dimensional characters Hattie McDaniel would not have won her Oscar if it were not so Butterfly McQueens character of Prissy as silly and vacuous as she was has some dimensionbr br Here though is maybe some of the worst racial stereotyping ever brought forth in Hollywood The companionship of Spanky and Buckwheat does show that kids get along racial feelings are acquired not inbred Its not the servility of the blacks thats objectionable but there total acceptance of it Right from that horrible watermelon song sung over the title credits the message of General Spanky is a bad onebr br Yet it did get an Oscar nomination for Sound recording probably one of the very few Hal Roach ever got out of the short subject fieldbr br General Spanky is far from Gone With The Wind though
Terrible The only way I could even begin to consider it funny is if it made fun of itself Amazing Its about an ass that fights crime And he drinkssmokes! How very funny! Its funny because where most people put things in their mouth he puts them in himself! And now hes getting sexual service from some lady! This show is so great! That is what I would have to say if I liked the show though Im sure you can see the obvious sarcasm Ive noticed some people have been comparing this show to 12 oz Mouse and Squid Billies Why would you even try? Theres nothing to compare The other two shows actually have some decent character development In conclusion I hate Assy Mcgee I twinge at the name of it
Very strange screenplay by Cameron Crowe (following on the heels of his Fast Times at Ridgemont High) has little inspiration and flails away at dumb gags At least Fast Times had a fair share of satire and sensitivity behind its slapstick (courtesy of a good director Amy Heckerling and Crowes undeniable penchant for capturing letter-perfect teen-speak); here Chris Penn (Seans brother natch) is the goof-off who makes life hell for straight arrow Eric Stoltz and the filmmakers seem to think hes hilarious Jenny Wright has some good moments as a mall-worker but Illan Mitchell-Smith is lost in a head-scratching subplot about a teen who seems to be infatuated with a shell-shocked ex-soldier Queasy confused nonsense given a shiny sheen and a soundtrack full of pop-rock tunes but characters one would hope to avoid Supporting players Lea Thompson Rick Moranis Lee Ving and Sherilyn Fenn are wasted in stupid roles  from 
Wow well you know those shock things they use in hospitals to get your heart pumping again? I needed one for my brain after watching this movie It literally took me almost 4 hrs in total to watch because I had to take a break and restart my brain to semi-normal functionality every so often I mean this movie goes soooooo slooooow its ridiculous to say that the script had about 10 pages of dialogue would be generous They just dont talk!! And while talking isnt everything and i admit there were some scenes where only the music was necessary and the music is great that was probably the best part but then go listen to a symphony or something and forget about the movie So many people give this awesome reviews and for its time id say the special effects and filmography is quite good but as for the acting or lack thereof it just needed a little something more no shootem ups or sex etc profanity isnt even required but a little more emotion these guys were like stones just sitting there with long faces All in all if you need something to calm yourself down just play the movie dont even start at the beginning if youve seen it before just start anywhere lay down and relax itll put you right to sleep
I didnt like this movie for many reasons - VERY BORING! It was interesting how they thought what the future would look like in this but seriously I was very bored watching this There was hardly any action Although the Classical orchestra soundtrack was very nice The visuals were very creative Whenever this movie pops on TV I feel like changing the station instantly Not because it is a bad movie just because I know what I am in for when watching this - complete and total boredom It is a movie I saw when I was young but I never got into the science fiction thing because it simply wasnt real Just like this movie - very unrealistic I never understood half the movie anyway
I will never get back the three hours of life this film has stolen from mebr br The film is basically a psychedelic drug trip disguised as an important creative process Id love to know what they were on when this film was being madebr br Its also the most historically-inaccurate film in existence; 2001 has come and gone without any of the events or predictions taking placebr br Characters are unlikeable design is simplistic and everything just rambles on without any sense or logic to itbr br And the ending is probably the worst of it: its supposed to be thought-provoking but the only thought that entered my mind is What the F$K is going on?! br br Id say for anyone looking for serious entertainment purposes AVOID this film at all cost and choose a sci-fi movie that ISNT stuck up its own @$$
2001 is one of those movies where if you dont like it you are told that you dont get it and need to look at the deeper meaning and symbolism Youre told that you clearly have a slow attention span and just want to see sex explosions and have the plot handed to you on a platterbr br Lets break down the movie shall we? Three minutes of blackness with something that sounds like a dying hippo in the background Then we get the opening credits A minute of fascinating shots of the Savannah Then a bunch of monkeys find a black rock and start killing things with bones Cut to the first of many 20-minute shots of ships doing things while the Blue Danube plays in the background A bunch of pointless dialogue and a group of moon scientists find another monolithbr br Cut to a spaceship thats too long for the crew complement--three sleeping people two people named Dave and Frank who have only slightly more personality than the stiffs in hibernation And then theres HAL the perfect supercomputer who runs the ship Predictably he snaps and starts breaking the First Law of Robotics Now this is something that has potential An evil coldly ruthless super-mind who controls the surrounding environment and can predict your every move And what does he do? He lets one guy float into space and turns off the hibernation machines so the three sleeping guys die leaving Dave floating in a pod He simply uses the airlock puts on a spacesuit and turns HAL off--agonizingly slowly Then apparently theres some psychedelic evolution at Jupiterbr br Heres the movie with the pauses taken out: Apes see monolith kill things Scientists find moon monolith HAL kills people HAL dies; Dave gets a prerecorded message and evolves at Jupiterbr br This is not me not getting it This is me being bored to tears by long stretches of absolutely nothing Sure its realistic but I find I have no reason to care No matter the message no movie can be good without being entertaining Frankly every character could be replaced with Keanu Reeves and nothing would change
I did and I lost two and a half hours of my life that I can never regain againbr br I honestly have no idea what the critics and fans see in this movie And thats not because I cant appreciate art I love a good film with profound messages brilliant cinematography and great directingbr br This film just isnt one of thembr br My main complaint about this film is that its so horribly slow-paced to the point of boring its audience to death On the other hand sequences of dialog go by too quickly and theres not enough exposition to let people who havent read the book know whats going on (My mother had mercy on me and explained everything before I watched it) Would it have killed them to hire a narrator? At least for the beginning and the end? br br Let me break it down for you: (Spoilers throughout) br br For the first two minutes you are treated to a black screen with no music waiting for the actual movie to beginbr br For the following minute and a half you see several pictures of sunrises and savanna landscapes Like the audience couldnt figure out how to set the scene unless they saw the establishing shot three or four timesbr br The next eleven minutes are occupied with the grunting monkeys They fight see the monolith fight some more pommel things with a bone Supposedly they are prehistoric men whose evolution is being influenced by the monoliths singing Not that you could tell if you hadnt read the bookbr br Finally we get into space Only to be subjected to twelve minutes of ships slowly spinning to the Blue Danube Waltz (A pretty quick-tempo-ed waltz as I understand yet here it feels absolutely agonizing) At last we get some innocuous dialog and rather cryptic exposition about the government not letting people land on the moon We are left to wonder about this for fourteen more minutes of Blue Danube and spinning ships and neat camera tricks with anti-gravitybr br Next comes four minutes of watching a ship travel over the surface of the moon and dock at a space station We get a little more exposition in a board room scene that follows Then were back outside traveling at a snails pace over the moon A second monolith is revealed again filling our ears with that horrible ringing (I had no idea that was an actual piece of music!) The monolith does its little light show and then the plot jumps forwardbr br Seven minutes of watching the ship to Jupiter travel By this point in time my brains had turned into mush Could it be moving any slower? Maybe its realistic to portray it as such but we still dont need to see five or six different shots of the same thing to grasp the concept of its realism Let me tell you about this realism thing; I cheered when the secondary astronaut character died Not because Im a sadist and like watching people die but because after five minutes I was just so annoyed at the sound of his darn breathing! Im supposed to care about this character feel when he dies! Instead I found myself waiting for blissful silence whatever way it camebr br Anyway now we get to the most interesting part of the film-the part with HAL Forget Dave the stick-of-wood protagonist The real star of the show is that coldly impersonal chillingly villainous ruthlessly merciless bad guy of a computer Hes great And the Open the pod bay doors sequence is wonderful But its too short And its not long before the director once again lapses into too-long goings onbr br Four minutes for HAL to die And die he does Slowly painfully losing intelligence with every minute voice getting lower and slower singing Daisy Daisy all with a low and constant hissing that becomes just as annoying as the heavy breathingbr br Seven minutes of flying colors as Dave enters the monolith Seven I could FEEL my brains melting and dripping out of my ears! Seven full minutes of absolutely nothing but some guys whacked out psychedelic version of space travel again with that thrice-cursed chorus! We got the idea at the beginning of the sequence! Why drag it out so long? Unless he wanted to make LSD users go psychotic and have flashbacksbr br Im not even going to try to explain the ending mostly because I dont quite get it myself Supposedly hes in an alien research laboratory and theyre teaching him deep and profound things while he watches himself getting older and older and then they send him back to earth as some kind of cosmic celestial space baby None of this comes across in the film For all you know its just a sequence of images with no purpose or plot whatsoever A lot of the movie felt that waybr br The first time I tried watching this movie I gave up halfway through The second time I suffered through this sore excuse for a film it was to help my sister time the sequences to see how long they lasted Its that boringbr br Call this crummy film art if you wish I wouldnt Ive seen more interesting art in the local museum And I am never subjecting myself to this kind of suffering ever again
All those who are into the PC culture are aghast at the dogmatic Christian view of this film claiming it contains racist ideation andor religious intolerancebr br Those who dont care about this but are oriented towards slick production values and competent acting are dismayed at the lack of such herebr br Those who decry both of these are apoplectic that this production was let loose on the general public as evidenced in comments herebr br What is an interesting premise which isnt original but is a combination of GHOST and FROM BEYOND is dealt with in a rather immature manner in this film yet done with gusto What the crew and actors lacked in sensibility professional abilities and technical expertise is somewhat offset by the intensity they displaybr br It isnt nearly as bad as many here think and would have been fine in the hands of someone with maturity and common sense and it is enough below mediocrity to elicit laughs and groans However it unfolds with enough intensity to keep interest throughout and is close to on par with a Corman-produced entry of his earliest period of work or the material of Arkoff or Sam Katzman If you get it for $2 (or less) as did I you wont feel disappointed but will wish you could have had a say in how it was made
I am completely into this type of story line but once the movie fired up I honestly said out loud  I just rented a two dollar budget Christian POS The only thing I could find to like about this film was it has a descent story but it was awfully executed Horrible actors horrible direction and producingbr br The director and producer need to go watch the cube before trying to pull off a movie in a single room There was absolutely nothing that kept you intrigued to the point that you didnt notice you were in the same room the entire movie Horrible! The two main actresses were very easy on the eyes and you could tell that was the director counting on to hold your attention But these two and their bios can speak to this are horrible in front of the camerabr br Dont rent this Unless you are blind because it might go up a few stars if you only listen to it
Do not waste your money or time Terrible movie Bad acting plot all over the place Really really bad acting Man this movie is just plain bad I shut it off at 7 minutes The script is bad the directing is bad it seems to me that a high school group got together to do a project for their drama class Yes its that bad The acting is not convincing at all mind you I saw only 7 minutes of it How this movie made it to DVD is beyond me br br It should have been left in the editing storage room I saw the cover and thought it was pretty cool I sures heck wont do that next time :_)
Lets see cardboard characters like Muslim terrorists have forced a cardboard scientist to perform some exotic drug tests on some cardboard people who have been drugged and kidnapped Youll be sure to laugh when these pathetic excuses for humanoids get their just deserts! Turns out the drug experiments have given them the ability to sense another worldthe world of religious fantasy!--complete with cardboard demons who look like they are made of Papier Mache Everybody gets dragged off to Hell except for one poor chap who goes to Heaven where he can presumably spend Eternity with the blockheads that created this Masterpiece of the Absurd I think Id opt for Hellfire myself Go see something else unless you are stoned in which case you might actually like it! Couldnt hurt!
Evil Behind You was created for a specific purpose in mind to shove the writerdirectors personal views on who either gets to walk on water or who gets to dance with the devil Sadly it would seem that the creators were so focused on making their point that they took its power away completely by force feeding their point to the viewerThe way its message is presented Almost reminds me of the stories Ive heard of the Spanish inquisition! From one real Christian to another Avoid this like the plague fear tactics never work when trying to send this kind of message!!br br The acting was horriblethe selection of Muslim terrorists was racist and unfair(theyre terrorists so they must be Muslims) The premise of this was good the story provided a great conduit for its message however it was the execution of these ideas that fell short making it very difficult to even separate the message from the messenger so to speakbr br Youd be better off dusting off your old Ghost DVD with Mr Swayze to better receive this message at least that movie didnt try to shove itself down your throat Or if you like Good Christian movies with a powerful message try End of the Spear
I gave this movie a four-star rating for a few reasons First I felt that this movie was definitely preaching and I hate that Still its my own fault for watching a Christian movie in the first placebr br My friend and I rented this movie because it sounded interesting The back of the case said something along the lines of a spiritual battle someone opening some sort of boundary that let demons into our world and the like Something I am very interested in indeed This movie almost hit the target It was more like on the edge of the target more on the tree than the target itselfbr br The basic plot of this movie is two couples are abducted by a group of terrorists to be victim to experiments However because their experimental serum is derived from the research of a scientist who claimed to be able to bridge the gap between the physical and the spiritual realms the men of the couples are now able to feel smell hear and see the demons of the spiritual world In that order Apparently the sense of taste is not present in that realmbr br This movie is very clichéd They took the title seriously as the men while chained to the beds demand their women look behind them because there is something therebr br Although a good effort for what it was I think the special effects could have been done so much better The demon scratching at the woman was in a word hilarious The wife was obnoxious as hell and everyone in the room practically cheered when she died We were all hoping shed be beaten by the other woman with the chair thoughbr br The message is one that I dont care to comment on other than I think the Christian filmmakers should have found a better medium for itbr br And so I give it four stars because it is not the movies fault I am not a Christian and dont like this type of message and I got a kick out of making comments throughout My friend and I watching this movie seemed to resemble an episode of MST3K
This movie probably began with a good idea but thats as far as it went When I read the cover at Blockbuster I thought it had promise but that was based on the overall idea for the movie The movie began with a professor talking about how in the future we will be able to see creatures from other dimensions There was no explanation of how that would happen but thats okay I thought it would be developed that in the movie It wasnt In the next scene we see two young men lying on tables with tubes taped to their heads Beside each one are two attractive women The men begin asking Do you hear that or Do you see them We conclude they think they are seeing ghosts or some other creature that seem invisible or they are hallucinating The women do not see these creatures This was fine for the first five minutes BUT THIS SCENE GOES ON FOR A FULL HOUR It is briefly punctuated by flashbacks that have no correlation to the so called plot of the film We are also introduced to a man in a lab coat and what appear to be Middle Eastern terrorists What is this about? We never find out The flash backs lead us to believe that the terrorists are forcing the man in the lab coat to perform diabolical experiments on these young people but we never understand why At the end of the movie the terrorists finally do what terrorists do  they blow up the lab but why? What is the point? We have no idea This film contains so many disconnected thoughts and ideas that there are too many to enumerate but one more notable one is that fact that the man in the lab coats and the terrorist pop in and out of the room throughout the movie and not once do the young men attempt to escape or even leave the tables on which they are laying even though they are not strapped down! The makers of the movie also bring in cameo appearances by cockroaches on several occasions but again we never learn what that has to do with the storyline Sorry but this movie was a waste of $4 and the time I spent driving to the rental store and then watching it Take my advice Dont rent it
I would have given this LESS than a 1 rating if it were possible The entire film should have been left on the cutting-room floor What a pathetic waste of time money and effort! Lets seeassemble the prettiest cast you can find (which of course is in direct proportion to the amount of talent they lack)throw together the thinnest plot you can dig upand viola! An abominable piece of trash that the director andor producer should be ashamed to put their name on How much WORSE can the horror genre get? And dont use low budget as an excuseI have seen many GREAT low-budget filmsin fact some of the best horror classics of all time were low-budget If you dont have the talent and ingenuity to make a GOOD horror film then for Gods sake dont make one at all!!!
this film is basically a poor take on the old urban legend of the babysitter who gets crank calls telling her to check the children she calls the police who trace the calls and find there coming from inside the house when a killer calls has a story so simplistic a little kid could have written it not much suspense it becomes clear who the killer is halfway through the film at the beginning when the first victim is killed it looks like a bondage fetish scene from a porn site or something whats up with that? the film is oh so typical slasher fare with a plot about as original as a Beatles concert even by low budget slasher standards its cheesy dont waste your time with this nuff said
When A Killer Calls has got to be the biggest ripoff released by Asylum so far Its about a sexy babysitter on duty who receives spooky calls from a creepy voice who asks her repeatedly Have you checked the girl? Naturally she has the calls traced by the cops (after having to perform some realistically unnecessary tasks -- hanging up when he calls waiting ten seconds and dialing 57) Sound familiar? Yeah thats why I rented it toobr br Well it should And I hate to say it but this couldve been more entertaining than the big-screen crapfest that was released around the same time if not for one fatal mistake -- Rather than revelling in B-movie ripoff glory it tried to do something original It tried to make the lead character sympathetic rather than having clichéd campy fun with her Mind you this couldve worked with a talented actress But she wasnt Sure she looked good and she screamed and cried but    oh well whateverbr br Then came the horrific ending Not horrific in that it was horrifying horrific in that it was BORING The pacing up until that point (about an hour in) was campy clichéd and fun Then it heads in another direction and it veers away from just another dumb fun slasher movie with a sexy teenage cast to a Hostel-esquire goreborefestbr br I guess this falls into the Oh well whatever category The lead actress flubbed a line? Oh well whatever I dont feel like reshooting it We forgot to give the killer motivation? Oh well whatever I dont feel like rewriting it The pacing completely changes halfway through? Oh well whatever I dont feel like shaving fifteen minutes off Continuity errors? Oh well whateverbr br If you like this kind of movie (dumb cheesy predictable campy splatter movie with sexy cast) then youll be fine up until the ending The ending is stupid its not fun its not scary its not campy or cheesy or quickly-paced In fact there was almost exactly five minutes of the character doing nothing but being tied up (and thats not a spoiler because its on the back of the DVD) and looking around at the stuff in the room then screaming and    whatever
This movie had horrible lighting and terrible camera movements This movie is a jumpy horror flick with no meaning at all The slashes are totally fake looking It looks like some 17 year-old idiot wrote this movie and a 10 year old kid shot it With the worst acting you can ever find People are tired of knives At least move on to guns or fire It has almost exact lines from When A Stranger Calls With gruesome killings only crazy people would enjoy this movie It is obvious the writer doesnt have kids or even care for them I mean at show some mercy Just to sum it up this movie is a B movie and it sucked Just for your own sake dont even think about wasting your time watching this crappy movie
i found this movie to be mostly a POSit was low budgetbut that isnt the problemthe problem isthe movie is just lameit doesnt really make a lot of senseyesit does explain why things happenedbut thats not what i meanthere was just no reason for it allthe movie also moved very slowthe last ice age was quicker than thisalso i think they went overboard a bit in the killsi dont mean they were too grossbut the killer just seemed to spend too much time smashing his victim over the heador stabbing his victim maybe im being pettybut i just didnt like the moviethe whole thing seemed like a lower rate version of When a Stranger Calls and maybe that was the whole pointbut so whatfor me When A Stranger Kills is a 410
To sum it up in a nutshell this film was disappointing and could have been shortened by twenty minutesbr br The acting was sub-par the only decent actors of the bunch being Trisha the killer and Molly The music was slightly lame but fitting and the special effects were much too overused The storyscriptwriting was poor the unnecessary tortureromantic scenes being dragged on for way too long and a disappointing endingbr br The start of the film was rather slow the fake-looking gore not much of interest Trisha arrived at the house and there was some premise for a good storylinebr br Trisha started to receive the threatening phone calls which heightened the suspense This momentary suspense the best feature of the movie began to build but then the friends crashed the place wrecking all potential suspensehorror in the filmbr br The plot then becomes obtuse from here on Chemistry sparks between the two couples and then the killer picks off Frank and the other girl This scene was dragged on and unnecessarybr br The killer then makes her way for Trisha and ties her up There is an overdone torture scene which goes on for at least ten minutes too long As the gore is done badly this is not entertaining at all and it bores more than shocksbr br In summary the first thirty minutes of this film sound promising but then poorly written dialogue and general lack of plot ruins this filmbr br 310
When a Killer Calls is an unusually nasty slasher flick with some very unpleasant and unsettling sequences The decision was clearly made to try and cash in on the remake of When a Stranger Calls by pretty much putting in -- almost word for word -- the phone call sequences from that movie They seem very forcedbr br Additionally the filmmaker commits the cardinal (but all too common) sin of having the heroines friends being repulsive jerks So for the beginning of the film we really like and are rooting for the babysitter (a nice believable job by Rebekah Kochan) but then shes joined by standard slasher-flick teenage friends and the mood is ruinedbr br The flick sort of works but it probably a lot more unpleasant than youll be expected so be fore-warned
There is not one character on this sitcom with any redeeming qualities They are all self-centered obnoxious or two dimensional My husband watches it claiming that there is nothing else on but I would rather watch nothingbr br The only sitcom that I can think of that was worse was Yes Dear At least that one didnt get 9 seasonsbr br Being overweight does not make a comic genius and Kevin James does not have the talent of John Goodman Jackie Gleason or John Belushi Leah Remini may have talent but if so she is wasted on the shrewish wife Jerry Stiller is convincing as an annoying old man Maybe there is a reason for thatbr br This is a perfect example of why sitcoms are derided
I cant help but be completely annoyed by this sitcom Its like they didnt even bothered trying ro write good comedy just rehash third rate jokes and hope it sticks The worst of all this is that its all so damm uninteresting and lacking in every waybr br To make things worse leading man Kevin James has a permanent Im so funny smug grin on his face that would be tolerable if only he once delivered in the comedy department which he doesnt he just lies there doing nothing like a big unfunny baby Which takes me to the relationship between the Heffernans- easily the most insincere and poor representation of a married couple on any TV show really headache inducingly obnoxious Remini spends the whole show as if it where a violent chore to even be around her own husband Jerry Stiller yanking the few laughs on the show is doing a 100% repetition of his role as Frank Costanza in Seinfeld only this time his hints mostly tread on water due to the inability of the central duo in recognizing a joke even if it flew by them The episodes just drift along in a stream of nothingness their jobs add nothing and their interaction is even worsebr br This is not even a waste of talent there is no talent here this is a laughless creative desert
This is a lame comedybr br Heres why: A man and wife sitcom Okaybr br The Husband is a douche bag The Wife is the Einsteinbr br How original is that? br br Jerry Stiller is just the same guy on Seinfeldbr br The gags are lame No witty one-linersbr br I have had enough Stop this nowbr br The Last Word: Stupid The destruction of the average white guy continues on ABC The worst part? Kevin James is actually a funny comedian He just isnt here Leah Remini is great eye candy but is unlikeable Wasted talent is the word Bad sitcom
A show about an incredibly dumb man-child and his shrewish hot wife 99% of the plots revolves around Doug doing something unbelievably stupid and then comes a variable: a) either he hides it from his wife or b) tell his wife she emasculates him and then its up to the father-in-law (Arthur: the typecast character from Seinfeld) to aggravate the situationbr br And the writers dare to say it was influenced by the Honeymooners (an absolute classic) and that the plots are drawn from real-life situations unless you live in a cave you know thats not truebr br Anyway lets just put it this way If Kevin James had been thin the show would have got canceled fromm the pilot If youre 12 or youre fond of fat jokes be my guest watch this show (or any of Kevin James movies for that matter)br br Ive noticed some posters compare this travesty to much superior shows like Friends Seinfeld and Everybody Loves Raymond -- Im still wondering how could anyone do that
This show uses a rather tired sitcom formula of the fat idiot blue collar slob with the pretty (and sometimes shrewish-seeming) wife and crazy in-law(s) With this show its fat unfunny comedian Kevin James as Doug Hefferman who works as a delivery driver for a parcel service He has a pretty wife Carrie (Leah Remini) who works as legal assistant and senile father-in-law Arthur Spooner (Jerry Stiller) who lives in his daughter and son-in-laws basement Kevin James Doug is your typical beer drinking sports loving TV watching slob of a sitcom husband who would rather watch the tube than deal with his marital issues He also has a couple of idiot friends who lend extra stupidity to the problems encountered by this shows couple Beyond the few laughs supplied by Jerry Stillers crazy old man character this show was generally unfunny Kevin James imbecilic behavior usually caused the shows problems that usually resolved by his wife This show continued a run of sitcoms with the fat stupid fatherhusband and their pretty wives that all seemed to run on ABC for some reason
I am very diplomatic in my reviews and as an academic writer try to give creative license to TV writers trying to explicate a true story This story about Karen Carpenter could have helped so many yet due to the directing and editing does notbr br The story in this case is not fully addressed unless one reads psychological journals While Cynthia Gibb portrays a realistic Karen it is sad that so much has been editedLouise Fletcher portrays her mother and does an excellent job with limited material and dialogue In this case I give the actors credit for surviving this projectbr br Why is the audience not permitted to see causation factors?American audiences are quite savvy and if they have cable usually educatedbr br I sincerely feel that I could have written a better story would not have edited out the truth and allowed the actors to project the realitybr br Richard Carpenter as director has seriously underestimated and insulted American audiences Karens story is important and it is sad we will never hear it
I have been a fan of the Carpenters for a long time read the biography watched the specials and saw the Karen Carpenter Story This movie really didnt show the real Karen Carpenter In the movie she seems to be a shy and a pretty much of loner (except for one girl friend) The real Karen Carpenter was much different She was outgoing and friendly She had lots of friends especially Olive Newton-John The movie doesnt even show Karens attempts for a solo album and her meeting Phil Ramone and his wife Itchy Karen Itchy knew the real Karen Carpenter in New York When Karen was in New York she did see a psychologist but it was voluntary and once a day and then she would leave to go to her hotel room Also Karen was taking pills to increase her thyroid so she could loss weight but stop taking them because the psychologist recommended her not too Also the Karens husband in the movie is named Bob Knight but in real life was named Tom Burris Also Karen wasnt divorced from Tom but only separated Karen was to sign the divorce papers on the day she died Also Agnes found Karen naked in the closet unciousness unlike in the movie where she was dressed in white The music was very good That was the only thing I would recommend on seeing it
Ive become a big fan of the Carpenters and I didnt really enjoy this moviebr br I feel it focused far too much on her anorexia and didnt let her true personality shine through I wasnt overly fond of Cynthia Gibbs portrayal; especially knowing she decided Karens anorexia was suicide which it clearly wasnt Although her family was not big on hugs and kisses I thought the movie portrayed Agnes (their mother) as being terriblebr br I did find a few scenes to be harrowing in a way such as where she sees herself in a mirror that seems to distort her and make her look heavier; I thought the metaphor (so-to-speak) there was rather effective When the family is playing pool and discussing her divorce and she breaks down and Richard is shocked when he comforts her and feels her frail body was pretty moving (which is probably the wrong word) as wellbr br Overall I feel they needed to bring out her more bubbly quirky side--her genuine personality Even as the focus of the film there really wasnt a point that caused one to understand what would lead her to anorexia (though of course no one can really know) and almost made it seem baseless The film was more poor-singer-with-anorexia than Karen Carpenters story in my opinionbr br I would assume that they changed her husbands nameprofession and all because they couldnt get his permission to actually include him (there were some bad terms there) but that whole aspect was inaccurate with the changes On this note I cant recall the movie bringing out her longing for a family and kids which greatly prevailed in her life and explains her whirlwind romance and quick marriage to her husbandbr br On the whole it ends up as a low-budget made-for-TV movie that just isnt very high quality and can be disappointing if youre a hardcore fan who is hoping to see beyond Karens disease I feel that such a legend deservesdeserved a better film as a tribute to an amazing person and an awesome voice
hey i really do not know why this film has been appreciated so muchperhaps i missed the pointThe way i see it  a lot of international film makers have made brilliant films that have dealt with schizophrenia and have informed excited shockedevoked emotion and compelled the audience to step aside from their own reality and thinkwhile it is true that aparna sens endeavor was an ambitious one in light of all the other movies  this one falls short miserablyit was too slow there were no details about anything and the ending  was completely pointlessit was not open ended or anything just pointlessso watch it if you want to see a good concept completely wasted
This is a film that really makes me cringe In 1951 MGM and Looney Toons were making some of their very best cartoons--with amazing animation exceptional backgrounds and great stories Then in the late 40s a new style of animation began to appear (such as the Crusader Rabbit series on TV)--animation with extremely simplistic artwork in order to save money Unfortunately Columbia Pictures cynical ploy worked!! Instead of the public hating the toons (as they should have) many accepted them and the Oscar people (AMPAS) actually gave this film the award for Best Animated Short--giving legitimacy for an inferior product Unfortunately in the dollars and sense world of Hollywood this soon began to creep into the products of legitimate studios--resulting in rather crappy cartoons Later it got even worse as in addition to lousy animation and backgrounds the stories themselves became almost unbearable for adults to watch The cleverness and style of the classic cartoons were gone And for this tragedy I blame in part GERALD MCBOING-BOING--one of the granddaddies of cheap cartoons The story isnt that bad but the animation is a horror and listening to the kid saying boing-boing incessantly is a pain
With several name actors (Lance Henrikson David Warner Joe Don Baker) why was Jeffery Combs given the lead? Henrikson would have been a perfect fit for the lead as would Warner Baker or even others in the movie such as Charles Napier Combs was miscast in this and did a poor job of it Everything he did seemed fake or contrivedbr br The script is poor Meaning that if Lance Henrikson (or another) had the lead role he might have saved the film (removed it from my waste of time category) but it still would have been a bad movie The screen play was completely lacking The director should have recognized this and helped the movie along
Felony is a B-movie No doubt about itbr br Of course if you take a look at the cast lineup you might have some high hopes for its entertainment potential This film is stuffed with all of those wonderful character actors that you grew up with the ones with the faces you immediately recognize even though you probably dont know their names Its amazing that the filmmakers were able to get all of these people together on one project almost like they decided to do a B-movie actor reunion The cast even includes a couple of really first-rate actors: David Warner who most people will recognize from Titanic (although my favorite of his roles is Jack the Ripper in Time After Time) and Lance Henriksen who many will remember as Bishop in Aliens These two actors have done some excellent work in their long careers and made some very fine filmsbr br However as impressive as this collection of actors is their talent is never fully manifested on the screen The writers of Felony spent a lot of money to assemble a dream-team cast and then missed their golden opportunity because of one important factor the common denominator of all B-movies: a silly scriptbr br We start with a silly premise The bad guys are caught on tape committing a gruesome murder and they relentlessly pursue the film crew in order to acquire the videotape and destroy the evidence But honestly why bother? In the time it takes them to track down the film crew a thousand copies of that tape could be made and circulated to every law enforcement agency and media outlet The criminals dont seem to realize how futile their effort is and they talk as if stealing and destroying the one original videotape is going to solve the whole problem Sillybut I suppose if the bad guys were so logical there would be no moviebr br Then there is the dialogue It is at times silly at times cliché and at times unbelievableeverything you have come to expect from a B-movie Of course I have always believed that strong performances can overcome a lot of weaknesses in the material This cast includes actors who are definitely capable of strong performances and although a number of the cast members are not good actors at all and have achieved B-movie status quite deservedly one still might be hopeful that the stronger part of the cast would be able to infuse some life into their parts However its disappointing to see that few of the actors in this film really seem to take the movie seriously enough to give it their best shot Theres not much inspiration evident in these performances but then again its an uninspiring script Now Ill admit that some of the more colorful actors in the cast do manage to add a certain amount of pizazz into the delivery of their lines but honestly even the very fine actors I mentioned earlier seem mostly disinterested and uninvolved with the storybr br Speaking of the storyeven if the acting had been of a high enough caliber that it made the dialogue seem a little less cheesy it still would not redeem Felony from the fact that its writer commits the ultimate faux pas of low budget action movie scripts: a plot with as many holes as a block of Swiss cheese You can watch this movie a hundred times and you still wont figure out how everything adds up In an effort to create suspense and always keep the viewer guessing the writer throws in all kinds of surprises and unexpected twists into his script and ends up with a jigsaw puzzle but when you get to the end you find there are a bunch of pieces that just dont fit anywhere and others that are missing I admire a good thriller that keeps me guessing but creating plot twists that exist just to confuse you and which are not consistent with the rest of the story is amateurish There was so much that was never explained that I felt extremely frustrated at the end If you decide to watch it be prepared to be confusedbr br I havent even mentioned all kinds of other silly things about this movie but I wont bother The funny thing is that despite everything Ive said I have to admit that I cant give Felony 110 stars Although I cant exactly put my finger on why I actually found this film to be somewhat likable The silliness can actually be fun at times if you are in the mood for it Plus I really like some of these character actors and even though their performances are somewhat lackluster considering their talents I still got a kick out of seeing thembr br Now I realize I have been rating this film from the standpoint of a serious moviegoer Its entirely possible I have completely missed the point It could be that the filmmakers intention all along was to make a B-movie Maybe the silliness is all completely intentional If thats the case and if I were to rate it on those terms I would have to say that Felony is a classic in the genre of tongue-in-cheek action flicks B-movie fans will love seeing all of their favorite actors together in one film will get some chuckles from the script and will be entertained by the healthy dose of guns explosions and chases
Lance Henriksen has a knack for being the top name in a B-movie even in this case starring along side Charles Napier Master Control Program and Joe Don Baker As always he does a great job of being the bad guy but the plot is just bad (dont even get me started about the ending) And the editing is so horrible it might actually be a thing of beauty Is it just me or does it seem that Joe Don Baker was spliced into the movie at the last minute? Also anytime glass is broken in this movie the editing is so anti-phenomenal Lastly after watching this I figure David Warner is dying for Tron 20 to finally get the green lightbr br Unfortunately for Felony this will be the third movie I give the rating of 110 joining Iron Eagle IV and No Mercy
One of the worst things a film studio can do is exploit the tragedies of others commercializing a shock or gore factor in order to sell tickets to be able to buy their Birch a new diamond necklace Another worst thing is to totally misrepresent the true facts of an incredible saga by fabricating events dialog and images to the directors own liking Lastly one of the worst things a film studio can do is to use bottom-of-the-barrel actors and shoot it all on a sound stage that was rented for fifty cents a day All three of these travesties the makers of this film are guilty of This is hands-down the worst movie I have ever seen and Ive seen thousands A score of 1 is too good for this waste of celluloid Not only should the filmmakers be ashamed for making it they should be ashamed for negatively exploiting the heroes of this story which are the people who experienced this tragedy firsthand both the living and the dead
I couldnt I was bored not just because the acting was terrible and the tragic story was simply a b-movie whose plot was all about the cannibalism but the fact I was watching a subtitle foreign film which doesnt bother me at all but was STILL dubbedbr br The special effects were awful As the back of the plane splits off you can see the model is hollow as it breaks away in the phony snow Most of the movie takes place on a sound stage that clearly is not real and almost looks like a play as the sounds of snow blowing all over are heard but not actually scenebr br But how what will they eat? They have no food one military person (Its never clear what this guy does or why hes in charge) says which Im sure no one ever said in reality or even thought about food since they were concerned if the people were alive not how theyd eat It was simply a stupid line written to point out that yes they will have to eat the dead bodies to survivebr br When they finally decide to eat the bodies one man finds one shirtless body who despite being in the snow for however long is not remotely frozen in fact his flesh is very flexible and fresh He cuts the fresh meat off his back that again is not frozen or even cold it appears and this scene goes on for five minutes Thats where I had to stop The remake Alive was a far superior film about trying to survive in a horrible situation that Im sure the real survivors praised whereas I cant imagine any of them had anything nice to say about this version It was simply about eating dead bodies and everything else was secondary Avoid
Making a film based on a true story particularly one as incredible and horrifying as the 1972 Andean plane crash is hard for even the best filmmakers But the Mexicans behind this forgettable and cheap exploitation flick dont even try! The actual names of both the survivors and the casualties of the Uruguayan air force plane crash have ALL been altered the crash itself is obviously staged in a very slip-shod manner and the cannibalism aspect has been unnecessarily and gorily played up Shockingly it made a ton of money on both sides of the border Thankfully thought it has mercifully been forgotten But the same people behind this would later give us the equally revolting GUYANA: CULT OF THE DAMNED!br br This cheap horror exploitation flick necessitated the making of ALIVE some fifteen years later That film was a masterpiece SURVIVE! to put it mildly is not
Leave Ed Wood alone To call Plan 9 from Outer Space the worst film ever made would be to deny this abysmally vulgar heap of Hollywood guano its rightful title This pretentious fusion of witless whimsy and bathetic sociopolitical commentary actually does seem to be formed along the lines of Plan 9 with badly-staged scenes of down-on-their-luck actors on cheap sets interspersed with what appears to be footage of battle and crowd scenes cribbed from higher-budget epics But whereas Plan 9 occasionally manages to be funny when it means to be and reasonably entertaining overall this tacky pageant is appallingly lacking in basic showmanship with scenes ranging from offensively unfunny (the disgusting burlesque of Groucho Marx stealing Manhattan from the Indians) to low camp (Hedy Lamarr attempting to impersonate Joan of Arc hearing her voices) to tedious (Dennis Hopper doing absolutely nothing with the role of Napoleon) to the unexpectedly poignant performance of Peter Lorre as the psychotic Nero Give the worst director trophy to Irwin Allen for turning so much into so little
Im an atheist To me history and truth mean a lotbr br This film is made after a novel published in 1921 which is still being updated up to this day as if it was a history book Well its not The movie is about the novels 1950s version Some actors were GREAT but that doesnt cover the plotbr br In short man invents a super-bomb so God and his friends hold a tribunal to see if they must intervene The devil analogy persecutes man and for defense we have the spirit of man What is the spirit of man anyway? And why was the first defendant Adam? Eventually you just get US Christian propaganda in a 5th grade history book of the time Though other religions are mentioned only European Christianity is exploredbr br First we get the caveman story The women are scrawny stereotypes of damsels in distress Real cave women were as strong as men and just as resistant Hard times hard life adapt and survive All this is watered down by mid-century stereotypesbr br Next we get Egypts first pyramid construction Today we see a different story and know that there were a lot less deaths and regular citizens at work as well Loosing mentioned amount of many lives in the process would have been a national disaster and nobody after would try to beat it As if there was only ONE pyramid buildbr br The part about Moses and one true god was as if the Spanish inquisition was asking nicely Inquisition itself was never even mentioned in the moviebr br Helen of Troys evil grim was so vile that I didnt see why so many were even interested in her In reality they were just soldiers following commanders orders who were discussing a political issue of power She was just an excusebr br The Cleopatra story was were I saw this film was to inaccurate and filled with propaganda Here brother was a LOT younger She was not obsessed with poison was quite educated to restore library content and was politically competitive to drag beaten down Egypt out of dirtbr br The part with Nero and praying Christians in a cave were disgusting Yes Rome burned down Yes there was persecuted Christianity But the way they portray it was as if the Coliseum build itself and there was no Vespasian to rebuild Romebr br Attila the Hun appears in a short seen and than we jump to King Arthur The crusades are mentioned with minimal bloodshed And there is no mention of the crusades east to Russia that ended in an ironic battle The knights just went home and started jousting for fun of it A LOT of stuff is put down like no indoor pluming hygiene and plaguesbr br Then they cover Joan of Ark where she always has to much makeup and looks like a princes Territorial politics were replaced with an unjust court The sidesaddle alone on a stool makes me want to ask how someone could follow here At here burning I wanted to yell Hura! Now die already! Cheap special effects where is the fire?br br By the time they mentioned Leonardo I already got fed up with the movie Columbus Spanish slaughter of America yelling Queen Elisabeth kick the Spanish armada and so on and so onbr br The ONLY reason I wanted to see this movie was the fact that it was the last one with all 3 Marks brothers And all they got was the scene with Manhattan and Indians Amusing but no more than a smilebr br The witch-hunts are mentioned briefly as well as plagues (after renascence) When they start portraying revolutions things gut power-hungry and anarchistic The US revolution was pursued by the French revolution Oppression and incompetence are bad but you cant just blow the old way up out of anger you must replace it with something So they replaced the French monarchy with new French monarchy So we get Napoleon and his ambitions to go to India by land But they replace his motives with unity and band him for only the title Emperor The conquests in Europe defeat in Russia are sacked to Waterloobr br The US civil war the English rich inventors (Tesla not included) Mister Watson come here I want you almost made me laugh for teenage reasons Technological hard work was watered down to the final discovery and comedic misusebr br Eventually after 85 minutes we come to world wars and organized crime but none of its horrors Adolphs words I invade Russia This is my last territorial demand were hilarious It was his LAST territorial demandbr br To build suspense God puts a countdown clock to doomsday on the wall for the final words All mighty cant pause the universe for a second? There was no need for the persecution speech but the defense made one last throwbr br Last we see the man of tomorrow as the final defense Apparently a paradox man because the bomb was to go of today His toys are a music box in the shape of a gun and a pencil box sword Now that is so wrong Pens and pencils drew so many weapon blueprints that its kill count surpasses the atom bomb And making music out of a weapon? Deluded egoistic generals make music out of weapon fire So the man of tomorrow is already a monsterbr br The way I see it all the defense had to do was blame the devil as the true conspirator for mans demise and case closed And honestly compared to all barbaric stuff our ancestors did centuries ago we are pretty humane at painless backstabbing these daysbr br To summarize all I will just quote Fireflys episode Jaynestown: Its my estimation that every man ever got a statue made of him was one kind of son of bitch or another Aint about you Jayne Its about what they need
I cant understand why many seem to hate thisbr br This movie ties together many of the overlapping settings of the historical and Biblical epics of the fifties using set pieces props and costumes similar to those seen in other movies Here however the story attempts to run through all of human history with a frame story about the human race being on trial with a guilty verdict meaning h-bombs will go off all over the world The prosecutor is the devil played with fiendish glee by Vincent Price OK so its a little hokey calling the defender The Spirit of All Men but I think thats one of the things that gives this movie a sense of period charm The Spririt of Man is incidentally played quite well by Ronald Coleman in his last film It is also the last movie in which Groucho Harpo and Chico Marx all appear but not together Groucho plays Peiter Minuet buying Manhattan from the Indians in a scene played purely for campy humor Chico isnt funny at all as a monk who thinks the world is flat and Harpo we are told is meant to be Isaac Newton discovering gravity Most of the other performances are well done thoughbr br Other hokey things are that the trial is supposedly taking place in outer space which is depicted as a region of clouds and blueness There is something called The Great Clock of Outer Space which when striking midnight may signal the end of the worldbr br But at its heart the movie addresses the problems of WMDs and the eternal question of whether Man is basically good or basically evil; and poses it in what I think is an interesting way Also anyone who likes the look of costume epics of the fifties should like the look of this movie
When I was 8 years old and going through my Marx Brothers phase my father read in the TV Guide that they were showing the Marx Brothers film The Big Store late on Friday night and set the VCR to tape it for me When I woke up on Saturday -- due no doubt to a misprint in the TV guide -- my father and I discovered The Story of Mankind had been recorded insteadbr br The Big Store was probably one of the least funny of all the Marx Brothers movies and nevertheless it stands as one of the centurys finest works of cinema when compared with The Story of Mankind I can almost justify TV Guides error in that the Marx Brothers -- Groucho Chico and Harpo -- appear in both movies Although in The Story of Mankind they are divided up into a series of unrelated scenes: Groucho plays Peter Minuit Chico plays some guy talking to Christopher Columbus and Harpo plays Isaac Newton????? Harpos scene lasts about half a minute; Chico only has two or three lines; Grouchos scene is at least funny but horribly racially insensitive by todays standards The rest of the movie doesnt bear mentioning They trotted out some of the finest actors of the day and made them recite total garbage What a disappointmentbr br TV Guide I sent you a nice letter Im still waiting for an apologybr br For the record: The Big Store has a wonderful bit of physical comedy with the Marx Brothers on roller skates and a couple of songs by Virginia OBrien I was really looking forward to seeing it
Irwin Allens first venture into all star spectacle was one all star disaster The Story of Mankind contains some of the most incredible casting decisions of all time Virginia Mayo as the blond Cleopatra Dennis Hopper chewing the scenery with Napoleon Peter Lorre dining on the scenery for weeks as Nero Marie Wilson as Marie Antoinette as a roadshow Marilyn Monroe thats just some of thembr br The film also is known for being the last film which featured all three of the Marx Brothers though they all have different roles Chico plays a monk who is Christopher Columbuss confidante Groucho euchres the Indians out of Manhattan island as Peter Minuit and most astonishing of all Harpo Marx as Sir Isaac Newton who discovers gravity when an apple conks him on the bean br br Holding all these portrayals together is a story where mankind itself is being judged A super H Bomb is about to be discovered and let loose will do in the worlds population Its Judgement Day a comingbr br But mankind has its advocates and detractors Speaking for the prosecution is Old Scratch whos been bringing the worst out in man for centuries in the form of Vincent Price But man has his good side as well and who better than Ronald Colman to demonstrate man at his most civilized best Colman and Price plead their case before The Judge played by Cedric Hardwicke br br In those three individuals you have some of the finest speaking voices the English language ever knew When the film is on them as they each bring out the exhibits for their case its a pleasure to listen to Then when the focus is on the individual stories you want to scream in agonybr br What was Irwin Allen driving at Im still trying to figure it out Was he deliberately camping it up with some of these casting decisions? If it was satire it just doesnt get off the groundbr br This was Ronald Colmans farewell film and while its hardly something Id like to go out on I cant think of any man who could have stated the case for civilization any better br br So when you see The Story of Mankind fast forward through some of the exhibits and treasure every moment the advocates are before the judge
Pretty stereotyped good looking cast the story loops in a wide and confusing arc leading you down a number of garden paths (without attendant fairies) before plummeting to an end that feels you leaving - hollowbr br If you are after a film that has climax or ends with a satisfying thump this is going to be a disappointment Inspite of the main characters notionally overt sexuality I felt that he was androgynous lacking a clear male persona rather like his lacking of a clear French persona Even though he is notionally laid naked (or rather sat naked) at the end of the film the viewer is as unaware as the character as to motivations - that little thing called plot Probably a stereotypically English speaking point of view at least if you take the side of the film
LAuberge Espagnole is less funny and less interesting than any episode of Dobie Gillis Where is their Bob Denver? Do they even have a Dwayne Hickman? A French man moves to Barcelona to attend classes He moves in with some other students who are no more interesting than himself and they do and say uninteresting things This movie is unbelievably bland The only bright spot was a pretty French girl who played a Belgian lesbian She places her hands behind her head and reveals shaven underarms not the usual tufts of dark smelly hair But bare armpits does not a good movie make LEmmerdeur was funny so was La Cage aux Folles LAuberge Espagnole and Le Placard makes you wonder what is going wrong with French comedy
I have seen previous movies from Cédric Klapisch and therefore expected a quality movie with psychological depth Having been an Erasmus student myself and having visited several friends studying abroad I know very well what it means to spend some time abroad and mix with different cultures at the same time Yes it is great fun! Because of that I thought I should not miss this movie Unfortunately I was disappointed to find that LAuberge Espagnol fails to satisfy in many ways: the characters are stereotyped the events are trite and the story is shallow Although there are quite a few familiar situations they are irritatingly cliché and do not go beyond the trivial events This made the movie uninteresting to watch and gave me a strong been-there-done-that-dont-you-have-anything-to-add? feeling Apart from that the movie lacks a firm story It sometimes looks more like a documentary or real-life show than a seriously made moviebr br However I can imagine that if you havent studied or travelled abroad this might be fun to watch
I was really looking forward to seeing this movie having spent a few (fantastic) college weeks in Barcelona myself The premise is right on cue--a confused & disordered young individual enters a world of equally confused & disordered young individuals But the directors weak swats at symbolism philosophy and social commentary were completely off the mark and it leaves us the audience feeling confused & disordered Bravobr br Perhaps if this movie had been presented as a European American Pie flick then Id be able to turn off my brain and go along for the ride But right off the bat the director piques our deeper senses by introducing the symbolism of the twisted highways and the dichotomy of the inner self vs the public self (ones mother tongue vs ones secondary language) Furthermore it dives boldly into the subject of racialnational stereotyping Off to an interesting start eh?br br WRONG Thats as far as it goes These interesting topics are hardly mentioned again except at the contrived epilogue-type ending which seemed to be the directors way of floundering to get back on topic It reminded me of a meandering speech which goes nowhere but the speaker ends by saying So in conclusion I hope you see how this relates to my original thought!br br Furthermore as other reviewers have pointed out the cynical jab at stereotyping betrays itself If the point is to ridicule the use of national stereotypes then why did the director introduce a cockney-speaking beer-swilling English brat as a caricature of prejudice? Why did the director portray the American as a neanderthal (literally banging his chest & making ape noises at one point) whilst the Europeans tolerate him superciliously? Why is the British girl the one who sinks to uttering slurs (calling French people frogs and butchering the French language) while everyone else is above all that? The answer is that this isnt a deep or well-thought out film Its simply an Anglophobes retort to the Anglophiles But really its no different from the prejudice it seeks to ridicule! Now theres a funny irony to considerbr br OK philosophy artistry & socio-political commentary aside I was still very bored by this movie There is one very funny gag which involves deceiving one of the girls boyfriends but aside from that I was hardly entertained at all The only reason why I watched it through to the end is that Id like to brush up on my French & Spanish (You see we monolingual Americans may be stupid but we do try)
Not a terrible movie But there are monster scenes where you will be rolling on the floor laughing - not a good thing for a actionthriller The acting is generally pretty decent for a SciFi channel movie Barry Corbin plays a credible US senator and Lou Diamond Phillips again gives us a decent militarypolicesheriffagentmarshal figure The special effects are well special - for example the external train shots are very obviously a model trainbr br Goofs: A meteor strikes a stationary car in the opening scene The car bursts into flames but does not budge an inch After the impact the meteor is lodged in the top of the cars hood - impossible from the low angle that the meteor came in atbr br Spoilersbr br A good portion of the movies events are predictable from the helicopter crash (Pull up pull up!) to the fact that the annoying people get it in the end to the classic blown bridge over a 1000 foot gorge awaiting the train to the sequel set-up at the endbr br The scenes showing the aliens attacking are hilarious They are vicious cute puppets and move at lightening speed - remember the Monty Python rabbit? Spoiler Goof: In one scene four people shooting clip after clip cannot hit a single creature because they move at lightning speed Later in the movie Todd Bridges rigs up a mini flame thrower which he uses to dispatch a number of creatures at close range On several occasions Lou Diamond Phillips is able to easily grab creatures with his bare hands
I did my best to watch this two hour fiasco It combined the awful special effects and plot of the original Blob with an execrable boosting of the (outstanding in the original) screenplay of Runaway Train The only explanation for this movie is that someone needed to take a huge tax deduction and figured theyd combine it with a shot at hosting a casting couch What an incredible stinker! Lou Diamond Phillips is anxious to show us why he will take any part no matter how bad Barry Corbin continues his career as a typecast creep a US Senator from Texas and plays it well He should next do the lead role in the story of Trent Lott or Jesse Helms The women in this flick all seem to have gotten their roles as consolation prizes in the Fay Wray Memorial screaming contest Special effects are unbelievably bad HS kids in film class in North Dakota could have done a better job The writers must have pulled a heist at the cliché bank to accumulate this many I couldnt watch any more without being forced to sit in the Clockwork Orange chair I have no idea how it ended except obviously 119 minutes too late Ugh! Caveat emptor
We all know that special effects cost money but it seems as if they could have used the money they saved writing the script to get some better shots The train is obviously a model in most moving shots the helicopter is obviously computer generated the alien looks like the one from the end of Spaceballs except its a decade later and Spaceballs had an excusebr br The only smart thing they did was blur all of the special effects to make them harder to seebr br Not even the actors could compensate for such a poorly written script and its pretty obvious they didnt really try eitherbr br Please dont waste your time Please
THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS OR MAYBE NOT THE WARNING IS THE SAME FOR ALLbr br Dang it Just when I thought that SCIFI Channel had used all of its ridiculous ideas for movies they give us THIS Actually the plot itself its nothing we havent seen in movies like Snakes On A Plane Deep Blue Sea etc That means a monsteranimalmenace of some kind is lurking in a close environment threatening a bunch of people In this case an alien in a train Wowbr br I must say that when I first saw this thing on cable I couldnt stop laughing No SCIFI film had prepared me for this; it was so incredibly pathetic I couldnt believe it! The actors are all a bunch of stereotypical-genre characters But since theyre not so famous (to say the least) I wasnt expecting much of them Except Diamond Phillips No comments there but I think the guy was desperate to find a job The problem was something called special effects horrible even for SCIFI Channel standards That modeltoy they made us believe it was a real train (not to mention the modeltoy helicopter bigger than a trains wagon) the meteor coming HORIZONTALLY from space the baby alien (a sock puppet and I aint kiddin) the regular aliens who looked pretty ugly while they were static; when they started moving it was awful the explosions (the terrorist blew up LITERALLY! And what about the exploding helicopter! Just how many barrels of gas was that thing carrying?) the insane mathematics used (they couldnt even solve a school problem right!) And I wont talk about that doomsday-like ending by that time I didnt know if to keep laughing or to start crying If I remember right I did bothbr br Its an ideal movie to have a good laugh alone or with friends But be warned; its so ridiculous at SO MANY levels and you need a heck of a lot of suspension of disbelief
Watching ALIEN EXPRESS inspired feelings of awe shock pity and yes sheer terror To think that actors who have done good work in the past should come to something like this The horror the horrorbr br Tell me if any of this sounds familiarbr br A train especially built for a political campaign is on its way to Las Vegas for a big rally for the candidate a Senator from Texas (Barry Corbin the only actor with roles both ALIEN EXPRESS and NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN in the same decade) At a railroad crossing in Utah a meteor incinerates a car waiting for the train to passbr br The train stops Local law enforcement is summoned Oh can it be? The Senator has a lovely young lady (Amy Locane from CRY-BABY and MELROSE PLACE) who just happened to have once been married to one of the officers answering the 911 call Lou Diamond Phillips (STAND AND DELIVER LA BAMBA) is the ex-husbandbr br Meanwhile eeeeevil aliens have managed to stow away on the trainbr br The train leaves Lou gets his buddy to pilot a helicopter so that Lou can drop onto the moving train (about 70 miles per hour) so that he can save the day As the buddys reward he crashes the helicopter into the mountainbr br Which is another example of how poorly written ALIEN EXPRESS is The cop heros sidekick must die we all know that But hes supposed to die near the end of the third act usually while saving several livesbr br Once on the train Lou manages to lose his shirt so that he can channel Bruce Willis in DIE HARD by wearing a wife beater t-shirt Yeah Lou is 46 years old but he hits the gym The part hes playing isnt worth bothering with but hes in good shapebr br The Senator is going to have an afternoon delight with Miss Utah but aliens intercede and both he and the woman young enough to be his granddaughter pay the ultimate pricebr br Soon we have bomb threats multiplying aliens and of course the train goes out of control and speeds toward its date with destiny while Lou and Todd Bridges (DIFFRENT STROKES) try to save as many lives as they canbr br There is exactly one surprise in the entire movie Early in the story a couple lift wine glasses to their thirty-fifth anniversary with hopes for thirty-five more years together The dude gets banged up but he and the Mrs both live Maybe the writers just lost track of thembr br This is the kind of movie that youd love to be a fly on the wall These actors who have done better work (and really deserve much better than this) are probably just happy for the work Did they actually think they were working on something worthwhile or did they cry (andor drink) themselves to sleep at night? At the end of the story the (fairly numerous all things considered) survivors gather in the last car of the train which is unhooked The other cars go over a cliff but the one containing the protagonists stops just inches short of the cliffbr br Lou and his ex are reunited Happiness reigns Id have thought that the first thing theyd do was get off the train so theyd have solid ground under their feet but I digressbr br Someone looks out the window and sees a shooting star Look make a wish Then another Then more and more The Earth is being bombarded with meteors that will crack open and creepy crawly hand puppets with big teeth will be everywherebr br Its gotten to a point that seeing the words The Sci-Fi Channel Presents on an original movie tells us that well be glad we have Ti-Vo so that we can fast forward through the next two hours Or better yet just go ahead and erase it two minutes into the story and spend that time more wisely
It is way beyond me how this script was ever sold much less produced and distributed The dialogue was so bad it was sickening The train and helicopter scenes appeared to have been done on flash cards by high school students Lou Diamond Phillips must have hidden under his seat when this --- this movie? was shown at a private screening afterwhich he most likely left by the back door The only emotion it aroused in me was pity for the cast they had to bite the bullet to get through this one I couldnt stand to watch all of it it was so predictable that it was funny Who knows maybe it will be picked up by one of the networks as a situation comedy
This is fairly typical for the Sci-Fi Channel: one-dimensional characters a ridiculous plot and terrible special effects Weve got some alien sock puppets loose on a train and Lou Diamond Phillips does his best with what little hes given to eke out a performance And save the day Everyone else in this is utterly dispensable; the ex-wife who goes through the time-honored cliché of first disliking Lou then of course comes to love him again at the end The obnoxious State Senator who gets munched early on and a gaggle of dull security guards who run around a lot Then theres an eco-terrorist who is in this movie for absolutely no reason whatsoever except to provide us with 3% more running around He spends the whole middle part of the movie hiding in a boxbr br The special effects really deserve their own paragraph We start with a meteorite that flies through the air trailing flames behind it at about 100 miles per hour According to the physics of this movie if you exceed the posted speed limit in your car atmospheric friction may cause you to burst into flames Then it lands on the hood of a car coming in horizontally Sort of like a velcro ball landing on a velcro floor I guess It really doesnt damage the car much just bends up the hood a little bit Later on Lou gets in a helicopter and goes chasing after the train Even though the train only had a two minute head start it takes a good half hour to catch it The CGI is so bad that the helicopter looks like its as big as the hills its flying over Then it flies into the side of a mountain - this effect must be seen to be believed It looks like they took a jar of gasoline and threw it against a wall then superimposed the flame effect over the helicopter About 10 times too big No wonder the helicopter couldnt pull up in time it was carrying five tons of nitro glycerine Then the eco-terrorist eventually blows himself up but instead of exploding in all directions like most explosions do he explodes upwards like a cannon aimed into the air Then theres the whole deal with not being able to stop the train because that would allow the little aliens to get off but it appears that the aliens can actually fly faster than the train is traveling so why this would keep them on the train I have no ideabr br Overall if youve got a couple of hours that absolutely need killing and its down to this movie or reruns on the Food Network well come to think of it some of those chefs are kind of cute Usually these movies have at least one or two things about them that make it possible to sit through them; maybe theres a sexy girl some T&A or a character that actually has some personality or some suspense or well something I really didnt see any of that here
What do you get when you put Lou Diamond Philips Todd Bridges Barry Corbin with a bad toupee and an alien all on a train? You get a very bad movie called Alien Express or Dead Rail that would be more entertaining on Comedy Centrals old series Mystery Science Theater 3000 You name it this awful movie suffered in areas of acting plot storyline and special effects In fact the exterior passenger train shots looked like the production staff used a common HO scale model in front of a painted background! The rest of the special effects goes downhill from therebr br The plot is very predictable and is similar to two 1970s movies called Horror Express and a disaster movie called The Cassandra Crossing At least The Cassandra Crossing had a better cast an engaging storyline and real train scenesbr br If you want a good laugh and a movie to mock at a B movie party then watch this; otherwise Alien Express derailed long before departing from the station!
I am a big fan of sci-fi movies So when I saw this movie in the EPG I thought I was in for a pleasant evening What a disappointment ! Such a poor display of special effects I could not imagine in 1980 but in 2005 ? Come on why would you do special effects of an helicopter flying in the desert when you can film a real one for a much lower price (I guess) ? And those killer muppets well I could do better than that in a couple of hours in the garage You can expect to have a low budget on a movie but I dont think its reasonable to have a low movie for any budget As for the star of the movie (I use a lot of quotes tonight) Lou Diamond Philips the guy is not even remotely an actor Maybe he should have stayed to the martial arts movies All in all an awful movie Maybe I am in a bad mood tonight Then again maybe not A sincere 1 out of 10
This is a truly awful film Lou Diamond Phillips simply calls this one in The use of miniature models of the train are laughable The plot seems to develop on the run (there is an alien on board; oh and an eco-terrorist is on board too; oh and the conductor is dead and the train is out of control; oh and the train is going to run into another train one hour ahead; oh and that train has nuclear waste on it) I mean come on really! The alien monsters are not scary (although there are a lot of them) and the acting is abysmal Check out the guy playing the next President - do you really think he could be President? For goodness sake he has spent his whole acting career playing bad guys!
Eh-heh eh-heh hey dude - look at these aliens Theyre like - biting the humans and stuff! Eh-heh eh-heh eh-heh br br This must rank amongst the worst movies of all time Its utter drivel for anyone with a modicum of a brain Sure you have the reviewers on the payroll who give glowing reviews and vote highly for this abomination but its easy to tell who these sell-outs are Their reviews are TOO good To give a movie like this even a mediocre review claiming it had some B-movie remedial appeal would be a glowing review! Calling this a great movie tips the hands of the corporate shillsbr br But enough of thatbr br This movie had about all the bad characteristics a movie can have without being SO bad that its enjoyable just to laugh at The old Japanese 60s monster films had a quality that this movie lacked At least in those 60s films you could laugh at just how bad the rubber monster suit looked Or laugh at seeing the strings holding the space ships how the models dangled on the strings and how the flames curved UPWARDS out of the back Those movies made fun of how BAD they were Alien Express (aka Dead Rail) seems to actually think of itself as a GOOD movie - which makes it incredibly absurdbr br The effects were awful by todays standards Beyond awful However not quite as bad as the 60s monster movies hence they lacked the comedic appeal The plot and dialogue were about as sophomoric as Ive ever seen made even worse by being every bit as predictable as you might expect I wont even point out the plot and logic holes in this one; it just wouldnt be fair to this pitiable plot (plus it would take to long to even get started) Most of the acting was awful; Lou Diamond Phillips must have been very desperate to agree to touch this onebr br SciFi Channel is rapidly becoming the cheap thrills channel producing movie after movie without an iota of concept or intelligence in the lot I can only wonder - why bother?br br Dont bother with this tripe It doesnt get any worse
Alien Express is one of the worst movies Ive bothered to experiencebr br The plot is predictable The aliens look like rubber sock puppets The effects would have been mediocre in the 70s but are just atrocious by todays standards Couldnt they take a shot of a real train instead of using an obvious model?br br The acting isnt great but really the dialogue is the worst part It gouges its way into your mind Dont you die on me Not now If you ever manage to suspend disbelief long enough to be absorbed into the movie youll rapidly be jolted painfully back to reality by the aliens the model train or the clichéd dialoguebr br The only reason I didnt give this movie a 1 is that it doesnt deserve to be rated so badly that some poor suckers might watch it for the pleasure inherent in a truly bad film
After watching this movie on tv I looked it up in the IMDB and imagine to my surprise a user rating of 76! This is not a good film Especially bad is the editing; the poor way the story jumps from one point to another was amateurish and a huge distraction Its not very fluently done I do agree that the acting was fairly decent especially Kelly Kapowski and that the story was intriguing enough
Some Plot Spoilers Aheadbr br The Nashville Networks so-called rebirth as The First Network for Men is a complete disappointment as was its block of adult cartoons The new Ren and Stimpy was just plain awful Gary the Rat mediocre at best and Stripperella pretty unwatchable This cartoon is mostly boring; if Ren and Stimpy suffered from gross-out overkill Stripperella lacked any decent shock gags funny witless gags clever gags or gags period The concept is bad to begin with: Pamela Anderson a stripper-cum-superheroine saves The City from an assortment of goofy supervillains This cartoon seems like an homage to superior wacky superhero spoofs like Darkwing Duck and The Tick but without those cartoons wit and good writing---or even good storyboarding Agent 0069 tries to vacillate between being goofy and sexy but she is neither and this cartoons failure to make her one or the other brings this series downbr br Watch your taped episodes of The Tick and see what a real superhero spoof cartoon is like
The first thing that struck me about this movie was the terrible acting The whole cast was so uniformly inept at delivering their lines that I started laughing at the awful dialog midway through the film An even bigger issue with this movie is that at no point do we ever find out what motivates the actions of each character The one somewhat redeeming aspect of the movie is Halfdan Husseys innovative visual effects However as eye-catching as they may be they do little to make up for the gaping flaws mentioned above A dreadful script mixed with community theater level acting does not make for a pleasant viewing I was honestly shocked at how bad this movie was
I thought of this movie when i watched pluto nashwhybecause both movies have randy quaid playing a retarded robot this movie made years earlier but probably written by a screenplay writer that drank the same biotoxic coffee or something like thatWhoaAVOID AT ALL COSTS even to pay tribute to the late great Andy Kaufman is hard to do herefind another film or just watch taxi reruns on latenight tvhis latka gravas character is so much more loveableTANK YOU BERRY MUCH
My wife and I saw this in the theater when it first came outbr br There were only 3 couples there and we all walked out about the same timebr br This is the only movie I have ever walked out onbr br It was just painful to sit throughbr br The theater actually stopped us on the way out and asked if we wanted a refundbr br Never had that happen before or since Pleae do not rent this You will really regret it I am really sureprised by the vote summary Perhaps personal tast has something to do with it
I presume you are here for damage to your mental circuitry - VALbr br Mike Nelson made me watch thishe mentioned it in his book Movie Megacheese I asked myself Why would Mike Nelson steer me wrong? I now know why the bots never trusted Mike Nelsonbr br The music is by John Williams which is probably part of his payment to the Devil In fact Im sure anyone who worked on this movie is probably in league with ol Slewfoot or is now cursed from the Executive Director down to the guy who ran the catering truck outside the studio Dont watchfor the love of Goddont watch!!! Not even making a copy and showing someone else will un-curse youIm doomed now I understand this I accept this But save yourself
If you like bad movies this ones a real treat Kaufman & Peters stagger around in robot costumes escape slavery only to wander aimlessly and find true robot love I believe this is the first movie that ever made me consider walking out I should note I was 12 and could be entertained by shiny objects
I really wanted to like this movie but the pacing was just way too slowbr br It was a nice story but it was really like watching a slug racebr br The movie would have been better served if it had some more action I dont mean anything grand but at least something in the backgroundbr br It could have also been helped by songs that set the tonemood of the more lengthy periods that were absent of dialoguebr br Its been about 10 years since Ive seen it so I may have to give it another chancebr br 310 or 12(out of four)
Little did I know that when I signed up the the all pay channel package with Direct TV that I would face a movie like this It came on right after another movie we had been watching and I was a teenager in 1981 so am not sure where I was at the time but I missed this moviebr br I also cant believe we left it on It is kind-of funny as it takes you back in the time machine to the early 80s but I think even then this would have been a painful movie It was just well too cute! ET was cute in a way but not obnoxiously cute and stupidbr br When I see a movie like this I come on onto IMDb to see what others say I am blown away that this thing was nominated! Wow the movie industry has come a long way since the 80s! Oh well it did show some old actors btw that is the other thing I was surprised about the lineup not a bunch of no-names but some real actorsactresses Must have been in their drug days! Anyways odd interesting bizarre and makes one happy they grew up!
To sum this movie up it is LaBute carrying his sadism over into the realm of comedic farce The predictable result is that he is constantly stepping on all the jokes by insisting on surrounding them with blood-curdling violence and extremely hateful characters There is also evidence of his continuing efforts to insult and ridicule everything in sight but then to apologize for it with weak gestures to the PC Basically the movie just doesnt work its plot is beyond contrived the characters are one-dimensional cliches there is no consistency or development of anything and the comedy (where it is not totally out of place) is the worst kind of High Concept drivelbr br Morgan Freeman and Renee Zellweger are completely wasted on characters that seem like parodies of studio-driven audience pandering--no matter what make them likeable neutral (and neutered) and full of moral platitudes Crispin Glover is in here just long enough to convince you that he doesnt belong in movies anymore Chris Rock actually has negative chemistry with fellow hitman Freeman--its as if they are acting in different rooms even when they are two inches away from each other In effect Chris Rock seems like a digital insert At least he isnt as annoying as Jar-Jarbr br LaButes 15 minutes may well be up by now Its already looking like hes overstayed his welcome
Renee Zellweger is radiant but the rest of this movie just does not work Its like a hamburger-jello-mold salad--interesting idea but who ever thought it would actually work on film? I like director LaButes two previous films--they were mercilessly honest and chillingly funny This film manages only to be merciless and chilling--with jumbo dollops of the cutes (As high concept think: the Doris Day-Rock Hudson movie Sam Peckinpah might have made--now reduce your expectations to match the present mass-produced state of Hollywood) That actors as talented as Freeman Kinnear Eckhart Vince and Janney ALMOST make their scenes come alive is a testament to the immensity of their talents to rise above material that just does not cohere I would have found Freemans corny feel-good-about-yourself speech at the end of the movie funny (in a Lynchean way) if it werent for the nagging suspicion that this unconvincingly tacked-on moral is meant to be accepted seriously
Okay this movie starts out and it looks like its going to be a cute comedy about a completely obsessed soap opera fan She has no touch with reality whatsoever outside of the soap (sort of the inverse of the main characters in Pleasantville) and runs away to Los Angeles to meet a fictional character Well it is a cute movie but at the same time it is ALSO a dark very violent movie about two hitmen who are out to kill Betty for reasons way to complex to recount here Either plotline would have been enough on its own but Nurse Betty contains both stories at once and the effect is very jarring I didnt much enjoy it
I was pretty enthusiastic about seeing this movie when it came out Commercials for it made it look quirky and I generally like Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock and the combination of the two seemed like an interesting idea Sadly I was terribly disappointed with Nurse Bettybr br Personally Ive usually found that graphic violence and comedy dont go all that well together and the only directors that have ever combined the two successfully in my opinion are Tarantino and the Coens There isnt that much violence in Nurse Betty but what violence is in it made me feel kind of weird when I was supposed to laugh Of course for me part of the problem was also that there didnt seem to be many places where I was being asked tobr br The film doesnt much work as a drama either Renee Zellwegers Betty the storys protagonist is clinically insane and impossible to relate to in any real way I will say Zellweger acts the role quite well and Freeman Rock and Greg Kinnear all do good jobs too The problem is in the writing; Freeman is the only person that gets to play an interesting character Its really too bad 310
A wildly uneven film where the major problem is the uneasy mix of comedy and thriller To me the unusual premise is clearly a comedic one and they should have gone for an all-out comedy For example Rock has some funny lines but occasionally he is too unlikable for a comedy The scene where Bettys husband gets scalped is too nasty for what should have been a less violent comedy An even better example is the Hollywood leftist writer preaching to us tritely through Freemans character early on about the plight of the Indians; I mean - yawn! They should have given Freeman something funny to say in that segment but that is of course much more difficult than to simply write him a boring PC speechbr br There is yet more New Age PC-ness in the form of the ending: the girl not only doesnt get the boy - she gets no boy at all; in fact the message is that the girl needs no boy at all! Bit of a feminist statement there The first half-hour is weak but the movie gets better - ironically - once Zellweger gets to Kinnear I say ironically because Im not much of a fan of Kinnears though hes solid here Zellweger is very cute as usual; she has the sort of all-American cute looks which should appeal to almost every guy and I have to wonder why more of such women arent represented nowadays instead of the dogs who inexplicably became stars such as Diaz Roberts Aniston Lopez or Barrymorebr br Since the movie tries to be very serious at times I have no choice but to criticize Freemans character which is the gangsters equivalent of the movie worlds hooker-with-the-heart-of-gold There is also absolutely nothing in the relationship between Freeman and Rock to suggest even remotely that they were father and son
By the standards of Hollywood this movie was filmed and edited as Hollywood movies are and therefore looked like a movie you would get out of a big-time production studio within Hollywood Thats where anything remotely close to having Hollywood standards ends This was THE WORST MOVIE I have EVER seen in MY LIFE! I am not joking The story was so unbelievably stupid and unrealistic that I could not contain my laughter in the movie theater through the course of watching this film I know what youre saying its a horror film its not supposed to have a good story its supposed to scare you Well let me tell you something the movie is not even scary in the least bit Its too full of stupid bits that cancels out the little suspense there may have been The acting was awful as well along with the scariness of the murderer who you constantly see through flashbacks locked in a cage jacking off Throughout the movie I kept getting a sense I was watching something that was thought up written produced and directed by a high-schooler who watches too much pornography Please dont see this movie spend your $850 on other things like a snow cone which would be much more worth your while
Compared to the recent gore flick HOSTEL which this movie reminded me a lot of-- I would say that See No Evil is slightly better but not by much The very complex plot involves a handful of delinquents who are sent to clean up a rundown hotel for a shorter jail sentence The kids soon end up being killed off by a lumbering religious psychopath who is cleansing them of their sins (I guess) The one thing I dreaded most prior to seeing this was the fact that it stared a WWE wrestler Kane He ended up doing a decent job considering he only had 2 one-word lines in the movie There are a couple fairly gory moments mainly involving eye-gouging and a quite memorable scene in which a girl gets a cellphone shoved down her throat-- probably the most effective demise in the moviebr br I cant say that this movie really shows us anything new and is definitely far from great Cant recommend it
The Cheesiest movie Ive ever seen Not scary just bad 1st movie made by the WWE and trust methe only person this movie might appeal to is wrestling fans It has terrible acting and The worst directing Ive seen yetI Found myself laughing at the storyline and bad actors I saw that the WWE people tried really hard to Put a lot of the wrestling moves in the kills and Several camera effects I think they copied a lot from silent Hill This movies not engaging either so If you do see it youre gonna find yourself tuning out because of its lack of Suspense The endings the worst No matter what youll come out wanting your money back
Porn legend Gregory Dark directs this cheesy horror flick that has Glen Jacobs (Kane from WWFWWE whatever it calls itself nowadays) in his cinematic debut He plays Jacob Goodknight a blind serial killer whos forte is taking peoples eyes out The plot be it as it may has a group of troubled youths cleaning up the historical hotel that GoodKnight resides in and subsequently being offed by him Hemmingway its not Starts of as fun dopey B-movie but soon gets too tedious to be enjoyable Glad I went in with pretty low expectations but even those werent met How can you have a porn king directing and still suffer from a lack of nudity??? for shamebr br My Grade: D- br br Eye Candy: Samantha Noble bares her ass briefly
OK lets start with the best the building although hard to believe it had electricity and running water after 35 years and a fire the gruesome walls and odd items found throughout were interesting other than that its not worth itbr br as far as the bad its done by WWE films WTF? is that supposed to make you want to see it? if anything stay away horrible horrible idea for them to make movies and allow Gregory Dark to direct it bad choice the previews beforehand were more interesting and entertainingbr br i cant even begin to discuss how bad this film is untalented actors & a disappointing vague storyline apparently many of the actors are from that show all saints its a wonder why i havent ever heard of them or their show other than that the bus driver which you never even see just him closing the door has had more action that just about everyone together at least he handles stunts for some decent filmsbr br i like to see scary movies i really do but this one blew so much the entire audience was laughing at it and cheering the characters on halfway through very annoying the child behind me was yelping more during the previews of other horror filmsbr br this is not a film to see even less if you have to pay for it
I had no idea this movie was produced by WWE Wrestling is lame enough Why did they have to soil their name further by making a movie as crappy as this one was?? I found it to be a complete disappointment If i had of known this movie was going to be as stupid as it was I would have stayed home and done something more entertaining Sure Ill give them the credit of the cool effects; but the killer didnt seem as scary as he could have been He lacked a number of things But Ill let you point them out for yourselves The plot was a great idea just could have been done in a much better way Maybe in the future WWE will stick to its moronic wrestling and stay out of the film industry
I got stuck in traffic (I live in Sicily) on the way to the theater (at a military base) to see Superman Returns was 15 minutes late and the only other movie playing was See No Evil there was no poster up for it and just a short description of the movie on the schedulebut my girlfriend and I decided to check it outAs soon as I saw it was produced by WWE I just knew it was gonna be awful The few people in the theater were laughing most of the time and it was the first movie that I honestly considered walking out on and Ive seen The Ringerokay I would have walked out of that one but I was too busy sleeping The death of the bad guy at the end was pretty good but other than that it was just stupid
Another movie with a star of a wrestling So far I have noticedwrestlers cant act on the movie screen This movie is no exceptionbr br The action is dreadful It makes you laugh at what they say and they cant be serious they try to act scared but they fail and look stupid The acting is horrible possibly from the bad directorbr br The plot was stupidJust some people get placed in a hotel because theyre criminals and they get randomly killed off The movie is stupid all the way through making it one of the worst I have ever seenbr br The only think and this is why I give it a 3 and not a 1 is because of the way Jacob Goodnight dies The pole through the head and the stories of him plunging was awesomebr br Overall this is a really horrible movie and you definitely shouldnt waste your time with it
After watching this movie I have nothing but contempt for any of those who were involved in the making of this abysmal film For one as a general comment the storyline was literally unbelievable and filled with incredible clichés all around The same obviously goes for the dialogue which panders to the lowest common denominator and manages to offer absolutely zero unpredictable original lines The acting was terrible as well with Kane showing throughout the entire movie at the very most 3 separate and distinct emotions Even the use of modern special effects failed as each prop was easily distinguishable from its real life counterpart Overall I would not recommend for anyone to even think about viewing this feature as it will most surely waste 83(not even 90!) minutes of your life
The first official release of World Wrestling Entertainments film division is a pretty basic horrorslasher movie called See No Evil starring Kane one of their big men wrestlers known for having an intimidating presence hard-hitting moves and one of the most convoluted backstories in wrestling And lets not pull any punches here; while this movie is promoted as the greatest horror movie of all time (mostly by WWE) it goes without saying that after having seen this movie I can confirm it as one of the greatest comedies of all timebr br See No Evil sees a bunch of juvenile delinquents sent to a hotel so they can clean up Of course a monstrous murderer (played by Kane) also happens to be living in this hotel and we all know where that goes Without giving away too much of the movie plot this film has all the semblance and structure of an early-1980s slasher flick with most of the clichés intact but without any of the scares that those films accompany And thats sort of the main problem with See No Evil It tries so many of the tricks implied by its predecessors in the genre that it comes off as predictable; veteran horror fans will easily recognize some of the gimmicks ahead of time and even those who have only seen a few flicks should tell what happens next Its too generic to be scarybr br The movies gory no doubt but its only there for the effect The dark atmosphere instilled in the movie gives off that feel of terror initially but as you get towards the end it somehow feels out of place and gets tiresome quickly The death scenes dont come off as gory and horrific as much as they do laughable although some of them are pretty inventivebr br And the acting in this movie is pretty bad too as the main characters arent developed enough for us to care when they eventually do get axed Some cant even portray fear properly; they just scream and cry in a vain effort to emote So when they die it only adds to the comedy because you dont care enough about them that you simply consider them the equivalent of Starfleet Redshirts to the monster Kanebr br As for Kane he simply portrayed his movie character the same way he portrays his wrestling character only he uses axes and hooks instead of hellfire and brimstone Theres no doubt in my mind that Kane can be a great fixture in the horror genre He has the look and presence for it; he just needs better material (specifically a script that isnt written by someone who writes wrestling shows) to work withbr br Now despite what may seem like a harsh review I actually enjoyed the film Its one of those laughably bad movies that you cant help but sit down and enjoy My main gripe with the film again is that its simply an exercise in filming gory kills and doesnt have any frightening or shock moments I enjoyed it but I enjoyed because it was easy for me to laugh off some of what was supposed to be scary moments in the movie If that happens because it was supposed to be that way the movie would have been rated higher But it didnt It got laughs because its a B-movie and it doesnt help that the directors previous experiences was porn flicks and music videos; not exactly overcomplicated things to direct anyway Nonetheless I enjoyed it tremendouslybr br If you dont mind a fun B-movie or funny horror film Id highly recommend See No Evil If you are a true enthusiast of the genre Id wait until the DVD comes out before checking it out Everyone else should probably go watch something else
Eight teen convicts are brought to the abandoned Blackwell Hotel to clean it out as community service They soon discover that its the residence of a hulking psychopath (Kane) who has a thing for pulling out and collecting eyeballs It doesnt help that the guard watching over them (Steven Vidler) has had a previous run-in with the beast four years earlier br br A guilty pleasure of mine are slasher films Most of them are poorly directed and acted but they still hold some appeal and entertainment value See No Evil is a good example of this It features atrocious writing and acting but the death scenes are pretty good and the movie proves to be entertaining The premise sounds like a mixture between Friday the 13th Saw 2 and Halloween: Resurrection I really liked the idea but it didnt work out too well It was really just a bunch of clichés and everything was predictable Screenwriter Dan Madigan just focused on the death scenes and nothing else apparently The death scenes themselves are pretty good and gruesome Director Gregory Dark did a good job with them and he came up with some creative kills br br The acting is pretty bland and unremarkable This is because all of the characters are one dimensional and we dont know much about them It was hard to feel for these people because they were pretty unlikable Kane is surprisingly mediocre I was expecting his on screen presence to be scarier but he didnt do that good of a job A second rate Jason Voorhees if you will The rest of the actors are relatively unknown and this film will probably neither help nor hurt their careers br br While the death scenes are gory they arent necessary scary Theres really no suspense just some gory death scenes Because of this the movie doesnt hold much of a repeat value Also if you dont like slasher films then dont waste your time with this one It will do little to change your opinion In the end See No Evil is a decent slasher film but it is generic and forgettable so its not exactly worth watching Rating 610
All right lets be realistic about this Nobody goes into a movie produced by WWE Films (whose owner has challenged God to a wrestling match) directed by a former porn director (the man gave the world the Between the Cheeks trilogy) starring a wrestler named Kane and expects a little slice of art on a golden platter If you do then you probably need to find something other than watching movies to occupy your timebr br So what exactly are we to expect from a movie like this? Well heres what I was looking forward to:br br 1) Bad acting 2) A fairly non-existent clichéd storyline 3) Kane walking around with a scrunched sour face that indicates his nostrils just found the potato salad he misplaced a month ago 4) Tons and tons of gore br br Well if youre hungry for some so bad its funny entertainment then this might satisfy your appetite because it delivers on all countsbr br Obviously movies like this are best seen for free but if you do choose to sacrifice box office bucks then have some fun and make a game out of it The filmmakers are nice enough to introduce us to each of the annoying delinquents by flashing their names and legal offenses on the screen This makes it easier for you to write down which ones you want to see killed and in what order You and your friends can see whose predictions are most accuratebr br I also suggest that you and your pals write down every single moment of stupidity and inanity that you can find Tally them up at the end and see who comes up with the most I think my grand total was 107; can you beat that? I personally want to know how after 35 years and a fire does this abandoned hotel still have electricity running water and a working elevator?br br I know I know the filmmakers are assuming that if you pay to see this then you obviously dont put much thought into what you spend your money on and therefore likely wont put much thought into how silly the movie is but that doesnt mean we cant point it out and laugh at itbr br I also like how the city wants to turn this huge hotel (which would be condemned and recommended for demolition by any sensible inspector) into a homeless shelter and they think the best way to get it cleaned up is to give eight punks a few mops and brooms Uh-huhbr br I think you pretty much know what to expect but I feel the need to provide you with a couple of warnings First if you hate crowd interaction no matter the movie then you might want to stay away The people in the audience acted like they were at an actual wrestling show Shouts of Kill him Kane! and I hope you die first! and Chokeslam! echoed through the theater showcasing what I hope is NOT the best of what America has to offer I usually dont appreciate such audience interaction but for a cheesefest like this I thought the commentary added to the entertainment value However I can see how others could be annoyed by itbr br Second and this shouldnt even warrant explanation the film doesnt shy away from the gore If watching a big ugly dude rip eyeballs right out of their sockets doesnt scream fun night at the movies! for ya then you know good and well to save your doughbr br I must say that I was a little surprised by the extreme lack of dialogue on Kanes part I wasnt expecting him to put on an acting clinic but I was hoping hed have some cute little catchphrase like Say goodnight (his characters last name is Goodnight) right before he killed a victim Instead he uttered four words in the entire film - Nooooooo! and I see it But hey he delivered them flawlessly!br br If I were a bad guy in a movie then my catchphrase would be something like Place your BETTS! or All BETTS are off! br br Itd rule and you know it We need a new genre term for bad horror films like See No Evil that induce so much unintentional laughter that you almost have to label them comedic Feel free to send me your suggestions For now well just call em HOR-larious!
Ho humm - - - More of nothing If you are a long-time Rush fan you know what this video contains: loathsome songs from the past the BIG 3 hits from the 80s and their last-ditch efforts to remain contemporary They do succeed in making fun of themselves by beating the critics to the punch by portraying themselves as dinosaurs Unfortunately they FAIL at protecting themselves from embarrassment Close-ups of their faces only add to the fact that these guys HAVE BEENbr br If you are have been following (as much as you can stomach) the band for a couple of decades from the 70s then you know there is no new material here Same old same OLD: 1) Neil avoids the press 2) no real behind-the-scenes (Geddy looses his SHOES?! Give me a break! Even HE thinks its absurd!) 3) no new insightsbr br A better video would have been to show the CREW setting up for 3 or 4 hours  just let the camera run And stop changing camera angles every 2 seconds! I understand the director wants to try to do something artsy But then offer a full concert version of 2 or 3 shots the VIEWER can choose We know what the band looks like  let us see what WE REALLY want to seebr br Do yourself a BIG favor: RENT this movie first
In comparison to other sand and sandal fare The Egyptian leaves much to be desired The film is very LOOSELY based upon Mika Waltaris well researched novel which centers around the Egyptian physician Sinhues adventures at the court of Akhnaton as well as his travels throughout Canaan Minoan Crete and Africa Unfortunately due to the moral strictures of the time much of Sinhues story (which is rife with romantic and sexual exploits) remains on the cutting room floor and instead the audience is treated to reels and reels of Victor Matures wooden acting Even Gene Tierney  a leading lady staple of the time  can not manage to look nor act her best in this flick and gives a rather somnambulistic performance which can only be justified by the fact that the actress was having some serious psychiatric problems at the time There is a great deal of rhetoric and theological machinations over the idea of monotheism vs polytheism but Michael Wilding is so tiring as the revolutionary Akhnaton that one is surely cheering for someone to off him and restore the old religion before the second reel My advice: buy the book from E-Bay rent something more entertaining like Solomon and Sheba and then call it a night!
I am surprised that so many comments about this film are positive Having read the book several times (and all the other historical novels by Mika Waltari) there is no way to say much good in this film If I forget the origins of the story I might consider it a reasonably good epic Of course to bring such a brick of a book to the big screen is a task not to be envied but it could be done with class I cant understand why even the name of Nefernefernefer had to be shortened to just Nefer I love Peter Ustinov as Kaptah and Marlon Brando probably would have made a better Sinuhe but the overall attitude is too Hollywood to ever make justice to the book Mind you Mika Waltari left the Premier of this film in the middle of the showing Thats how much he liked it
The CinemaScope color cinematography of Leon Shamroy is quite remarkable hereincluding his use of colored filters forbr br various scenes The Alfred Newmann Score has to be the most sensual and seductive score Hollywood ever produced Its a shame it is no longer available on CD The actors however never rise to the occasion The accents are so varied from the subdued British of Ustinov and Purdom to the Hollywood of Baxter and Mature that it seems a true hodgepodge with no central vision Tommy Rettig is jarringly American Acting styles span the range from zombie-like to stilted Only Ustinov as a conniving one-eyed servant steals the show - what there is of it to steal The premise - the story of a young Egyptian doctor seduced and abandoned by the rich - and the parallel theme of the cult of the single God Ra - persecuted by the authorities has its interesting points But when the films plot fades it is the haunting music and visuals that remain
I would like to comment on how the girls are chosen why is that their are always more white women chosen then their are black women every episode their is always more white women then black ones as if to say white women are better looking then black women I would like for once see more black women then white and it not just your show its like that in a lot of shows always more whites but i would have thought since you as the head honcho of the show you would see this yourself and have more black women on your show but you are just like the rest trying to act like you are so fair and nice you are just a big fony hypocrite
Tyra & the rest of the modeling world needs to know that real women like myself and my daughter dont care to see all the ridiculous modeling to sell something Weird locations too much makeup & too much skin is not necessary Sex does not always sell when you are selling to women The same goes for the horse stomping runway walk that looks unnatural People come in all shapes & sizes & they need to have that on the show My daughter has a 36 inseam is tall & slender & a size 5 I am more average at a size 12 We would like to see both- I can not picture how something would look on me when a size 2 is wearing it it will not fit the same way on me I do not buy magazines anymore because they are one sided on this matter We would really love the show to consider women of all sizes Thank you
In watching this off and on for a few seasons two things come to mind: One - wondering what kind of girl wants to be a model and two - run to the nearest ice cream store and have a low fat sundaebr br I tried to be a fan because I liked the idea of this reality show competition No other famous model thought of this and it is very admirable for Tyra Banks to do so But as the series goes on and on Ive come to the conclusion that this is a sorry lot of folks trying to make a mountain out of a molehill Women shouldnt watch this teens should stay clear of it unless theyre doing book reports on the subjectbr br Many women try out for slots to compete for Americas Next Top Model They live together cat fight together cry together get put through pointless modeling shoots with pointless modeling people and fashionatas and get eliminated and almost all of them claim You will see me again Heck Im trying to see what happened to the ones that DID win actuallybr br This is the dream of some girls and good for them In watching this I hope the other girls that see this and run like Hades the other way - like to collegebr br I just happened to watch more of this recent season because of the ploy of full figured models joining the group That even made me think more of this as a sorry lot of folks The full figured models were no more than average sized ladies competing with what I think is the thinnest group of models they ever chose - so of course that would make them look even fatter - a ploy fashionatas use all the time Bad bad Tyra and crewbr br But to be fair Americas Next Top Model is not about full figured models its about projecting an imagined image a beauty that can be mass marketed and sold as the ultimate in beauty - and this show is just looking for the next fresh piece of meat to add to the mix Hence the name of the show Hence the sorry lot of judges photographers associations Hence Tyra and her consistent this was me plugs every camera angle you can get But then again that IS the one thing I like about this show - the ex-model giving others who wouldnt have the chance -- a chance to enter the doors But after thateverything else is status quo for that industry which is why there are no surprises or week to week interest in the program
Tyra Banks needs to teach these girls that its not all about being beautiful on the outside The inside counts for something too A lot of the past winners have looked semi decent but are horribly cruel and starting trouble for the other girls I see Tyra less involved with the girls in every season About the only thing worth watching Top Model for is Mr Jay Manuel Recently Tyra had a contestant who was a pre-op transsexual I felt that she should have done more to encourage her It was obvious that she had insecurities about her original anatomy showing through her feminine look Tyra should have given her tips or perhaps she could have sent resident Trannie Ms Jay to help the girl out Instead the contestant was met with harsh criticism and not enough positive criticism Its a shame because I truly enjoyed the first 3 seasons Theres a reason why Project Runway has all 4 seasons out on DVD and Top Model only has 1 season on DVD Its called taste Top Model seriously needs a lot of revamping an some more humanity
This is by far the most vapid idiotic insanely stupid show that has EVER been on the air and this is coming from someone who remembers San Pedro Beach Bumsbr br My wife loves watching reality shows--and there was one episode of this drivel where the wannabes had to develop a walk The end result was straight out of Monty Pythons Ministry of Silly Walks sketch I couldnt laugh hard enoughbr br And then theres the ubiquitous Ms Banks (as in laughing all the way to the) She has to be the most annoying self-important woman on TV since Rosie ODonnell left The View As if modeling was doing great things for mankind Please Ive never found her attractive and I dont find her intelligent now that she has the temerity to open her mouthbr br Someone needs to tell these human clothes hangers to eat a healthy diet and actually look like real women
I was wondering what possessed the organizers of the Victoria Film Festival to include this film in their program I guess they must have agreed with the others who have reviewed this film I on the other hand consider it the worst film I have ever seen It starts with a bad script full of holes and dialog so unlikely its embarrassing Ideas are introduced then dropped with no development The acting left me totally cold and uninvolved The set decoration was appropriate for the time but a decorators nightmare The only way the characters could love this house is if their previous homes had been ghastly The attic looked as if the items had been thrown in for the scene with no attempt to create the look of a real attic that has been filling with junk over the years The photography was leaden and lacking in variety Save your money for something worthwhile
Tamara Anderson and her family are moving once again as her itinerant painter father chases his next landscape Fifteen years old she is in her rebellious stage Already angry at her father for their frequent relocations her anger is exacerbated when her mother is suddenly confined to a sanatorium for tuberculosis Her mothers absence causes Tamara to lash out at her father and seek comfort in religion the boy next door Rusty as well as the spirit of the dead teenager who used to live in her rented housebr br The story is modest to a fault Its oddly paced and even during its emotional scenes there isnt any tension The actors portraying the parents are fine Alberta Watson is incredibly charismatic as the sick mother and Maria Ricossa is particularly effective as the guilt-ridden mother of the dead teenager But Katie Boland as Tamara is too amateurish to carry the movie The dialog is very natural and Boland cant quite pull it off She has her moments and when she hits them she can be good but there were too many times when she came off awkward One can see her thinking ok this is what my line is and this is the face im supposed to make rather than actually reacting to the other actors Shes not the only one Kevin Zegers as Rusty and Megan Park as his sister Brenda also suffer from stilted delivery but at least theyre in fewer scenesbr br If done right the screenplay could have made her an affecting movie And it has it moments but much of it is bogged down with an amateurish lead performance and flat directing
The director seems like a good solid man His parents struggle with the same issues we all cope with They strayed from each other They loved each other They misunderstood each other And the poor audience has to sit through ninety minutes of what is possibly the trials and tribulations of one of the most boring families ever to come out of Long Islandbr br There are few interesting choices in this documentary--the music is banal the filming uninspired and the story is the same story that has played out on every Birch Street in every town in America I dont mean to sound too harsh--seldom has a sweeter more well-intentioned documentary been made The director is the kind of man with whom youd want to be friends You just wish he had struggled as much presenting the material as his parents did keeping their marriage alive
This documentary is rife with problemsbr br How arrogant is it to make a documentary about your own family? I understand you think the subject is interesting I was bored with it This isnt a fascinating story to me and I dont know why you would think it wasbr br I dont want to come off as mean but I have to say: Most of the people in this film are just not attractive And thats OK not everyone is pretty But your camera technique to stick the lens in their face so you cant help but be overwhelmed by their unpleasant appearance because it is filling your 47 TV is not enjoyable I had to put my hand up half the time to shield myself from the warts wrinkles bags under eyes and yellow teeth Really Im trying not to sound inhuman but pull the camera back so its not like total strangers are breathing in my facebr br The camera work in this film is rank amateur level Its the kind of camera work you see from everyone with a camcorder at a family picnic Uninteresting framing unsteady even static shots are done carelessly Put a little effort into it if youre going to do this for a livingbr br I honestly cant see what the big deal is about this thing
After seeing the movie I feel the father and the mother are both reasonable person although not perfect at all On the contrary I dont like the author and his two sistersbr br Is a persons journal an accurate portrait of herself? No Most of time people only write problems in her journal because she want to solve the problem So a journal is always a more negative side of a person In this movie the author judge his mothers life by her journal Not a wise choicebr br The authors elder sister is so ugly external and internal First she said her fathers second marriage is not fair for her mother Then she said she doesnt love her mother So she dont love both father and mother I doubt she love anybody in the world Her face is so ugly just a reflection of her heart Through out the movie I feel the author and his sisters are lack of love and respect to their parents However I feel the father are mother are very loving to their children even the author try to portrait them as cold deceitful person
Excellent example of the disaster that happens when you combine a challenging script with two actors chosen for physical appeal It is rare for me to be consciously aware of the acting during the first viewing of a movie because I try to just go with the story and save the analysis for the second viewing In the case of Full Ride the acting was so weak that the movie was impossible to appreciate as a story; I was too busy (during first and only viewing) alternating between laughter and nauseabr br Fortunately for most individual members of the cast pretty much everyone in the ensemble is weak the individual talent limitations do not contrast with any actual competent acting Riley Smith and Meredith Monroe are at least well matched physically finding common ground in looking far too old for the credible age of their charactersbr br Unfortunately the script requires especially intense and convincing performances to portray their characters which just exposes Smith and Monroes staggering lack of talent On the positive side they know enough to not look directly into the camera and they do not stutterbr br Better to have used a less attractive pair who could physically pass for the proper age The basic story is not particularly original just another variation on An Officer and a Gentleman but it would have provided a nice showcase for a talented pair of teenage actorsbr br Then again what do I know? Im just a child
This is movie is really bad I like to flip on the TV while napping and this movie looked like it would be something good to sleep through and boy was I wrong My body literally woke me up from sleeping and said Hey this movie is awful you gotta watch it I love bad movies with bad actors and stupid plots Something about unintentional comedy gets me going This movie is impressively crappy I really dont know how to properly express it aside from recommending you watch it just to see how bad it is I mean seriously you should watch it with people I was making the best jokes outloud during this movie and no one was there to hear thembr br Worse than Swimfan Its that bad
Last fall (of 2001) I took a film class that was taught by the director of this movie (Mark Hoeger) His vast knowledge of filmmaking his ability to dissect any scene of a film and his winning of an Academy Award in some obscure category seemed to give him more credibility than your average independent film director When he mentioned during one of his classes that he had just finished directing a film called Full Ride and was in the post-production stages my interest was piqued However that would be the last I would ever hear of that film project Until last weekbr br Last week I saw in a TV listing that Full Ride was going to be showing on the WB network This immediately raised a red flag as I cant help but associate WB with teensploitation shows such as Dawsons Creek Charmed etc PLUS the fact that Full Ride was going to be released straight to TV wasnt too flattering in itself But nevertheless I set aside that time and sat down to watch my former film teachers creationbr br After two hours passed and the end credits began to roll I thought long and hard about what I had just seen What I had just seen was a typical WB-quality show stretched out to the length of two hours In fact it almost seemed as if this movie was made with the sole intent of only showing on the WB network Critiquing this movie will basically be like critiquing a typical WB showbr br Where to begin? The characters are shallow the story is cliche in every sense of the word the scenes are completely contrived and the character development is forced and unbelievable This movie just screams unoriginalbr br The main character Matt Sabo is some hot shot from the wrong side of the tracks (literally) who plays solid high school football as a fullback but then fizzles off into a life of crime He is then offered a chance at a full ride scholarship instead of going to jail Obviously without much of a choice he agrees to play football with an all-star football team but is not excepted among his peers because of his poor team spirit and bad attitudebr br Then comes the love interest Of course! Where would this predictable fanfare be without a love interest? She comes in the form of Amy Lear (played by the beautiful Meredith Monroe) She is actually a likable character as opposed to the ever-so-abrasive Matt Sabo so we almost applaud her when she rejects him at first But of course the inevitable comes to pass She falls for him changes his attitude towards everything and all seems good and happy But now its time for conflict!br br Earlier in the movie Amy makes it clear to Matt that she doesnt want to score with him because it would be shameful to her and her mother This is much to Matts dismay and his football buddies (yes they eventually warm up to him) who bet him he wouldnt get any But of course Matt eventually comes to accept these terms and decides hes not all about the nookie Heres where the exciting plot thickens If you dont want me to ruin this surprise then skip aheadbr br [BEGIN SPOILER]br br Matt finds out from some local guys that apparently Amy Lear always tries to score with a guy each year from the All-Star team so that she can try to use him to escape her small town life of working in a cafeteria (which is baffling in the first place) and make it to the big city Suddenly realizing hes been used and that his love was a sham Matt it tempted to turn back to a life of crime and leave the football camp before the big game Amy tries to reassure him that she was really in love this time but hes too hot-headed to buy it So what will Matt do? Will he take her back? Or will he go back to robbing gas stations and being an all-round jerk? I wont ruin the super-ultra-surprising ending for youbr br [END SPOILER]br br So if I somehow got you pumped up for this movie please realize that that was my sarcasm and not genuine enthusiasm This movie is an uninspired version of Varsity Blues or Summer Catch And thats not saying much Theres hardly any comedy to save it and the characters are too shallow to care about So what do you have left? Not a whole lotbr br What I most disliked about the movie was how much of an unflattering picture Hoeger painted of Nebraska through this film It seems like he was trying to capture the essence of rural Nebraska and teenage life in the small towns but his approach is all too stereotypical and shallow The characters high hopes for making in the big city and the actions they take to do so are greatly exaggerated and it only further cements the stereotype of Nebraskans being a bunch of hicks living in farm communities I am unsure of whether or not Hoegers intentions were good in trying to put his home state in the spotlight but I think he ended up with a very shameful product If Hoeger wanted to portray Nebraska in a favorable light he should have taken a note or two from Alexander Payne While Payne simply chooses to use Nebraska as a backdrop for his films Hoeger integrates it into the plot of Full Ride and becomes so entangled in his awareness of where hes shooting that he ends up churning out superficial garbage that would seem to come from an outsider If Hoeger actually lived here youd think hed know better than thatbr br All in all I am completely disappointed in Hoegers first big film and I hope that next time he can combine his knowledge with a little bit of originality to create something different and thought-provoking
If this movie were in production today it would probably have the christian right-wingers screaming child porn It is far from a great film in fact it is rather pedestrian However if you have an imagination and a fond remembrance of youth and first love I recommend it
Ive got as much testosterone as the next bloke and Raquel Welch at her finest is certainly worth a look; but the fact is that a cardboard cut-out could act better and an hour and half of Ms W showing off her considerable assets does not a movie makebr br Considering the cast its surprising that its as bad as it is Ive never been a big fan of Wagner and his tough guy Harry is about as convincing as a 9-dollar bill Godfrey Cambridge and Vittorio de Sica both of whom I usually enjoy seem to be sleeping through their lines; and as for Edward Gwell I can only assume he was there for the paycheckbr br This film is a mess: from non-existent plot through stop-start action and unfunny script to puerile slapstick and annoying 60s caper music If it werent for Miss Welch Id have given it a 0br br That said she is a treat to the eyes - even better than her delicious cameo in Bedazzled - and for that reason alone I gave it a 3
Following his role in the fine caper SEVEN THIEVES (1960) – which I’ve watched several years back – Edward G Robinson seemed to be stuck playing elderly criminal mastermind types (apart from the odd juicy role as in THE CINCINNATI KID [1965]) I’d previously watched the pretty good “Euro-Cult” effort GRAND SLAM (1967) and apart from this I’ve yet two more similar titles from Italy to check – one of which was directed by future goremeister Lucio Fulci! Anyway this is the kind of international production – featuring American and Italian actors and a British director – which was prevalent during the 1960s; it’s harmless and easy-going in itself but hardly memorable and definitely overlong – especially since to procure finance for the heavy-duty equipment required for the heist (such as an army tank and an airplane!) the gang involved have to pull a variety of minor thefts firstbr br The gang of course is an incompetent lot led by an American (Robert Wagner) and his bimbo girlfriend (Raquel Welch) – the others are a ‘pacifist’ black man a perennially hungry Italian and a diminutive Englishman They try to induce an ex-gangster (Vittorio De Sica) to turn over his fortune to them except he’s destitute…but under the auspices of “Professor” Robinson he proposes instead a caper of 5 million dollars’ worth of platinum! Needless to say the gang members don’t trust one another (Wagner instructs Welch to seduce De Sica so as to get the name of their fence in Morocco – where they are to retreat after the robbery) or else bungle the job (commissioned to hold up a restaurant the Italian can’t resist sitting at table and order a multi-course meal for himself!) Amusingly in the face of similar failures De Sica tries to show them how they used to do it in the old days – however ostensibly holding up a petrol station it transpires that the owner is a nephew of his and he merely asked to borrow some cash! br br The central heist sequence is typically elaborate: while the gang including Welch ‘take’ the train transporting the platinum Wagner kidnaps pilot Victor Spinetti and his airplane When the job is done he fully intends to double-cross De Sica – but neither his partners nor Welch herself are willing to go along with this so he’s forced to relent Coming from the time when crime didn’t pay the gang contrives to lose all their stash in mid-air when the plane’s bomb-bay doors are accidentally opened…
This movie is a cinematic collage of gangster clichés The writing is grade z and the plot and story are constructed without care or logic It a messy pastiche of stereotypical gangsters (think of Bugs Bunny cartoons) and silly supporting characters (the lady doctor and the writer) There are much better Bogart films out there In fact Bogart looks like he slept through this performance He puts very little effort into this character I think the directorial advice he received was something like Hes a bad guy Act bad This guy is the eras equivalent of Darth Vader; obvious evil and the anti-hero Dont waste your time with this one
Although Humphrey Bogart got star billing in King Of The Underworld Im willing to bet he didnt thank Jack Warner for it In fact this film was one hollow crownbr br King of the Underworld was supposedly a remake of the Paul Muni film Dr Socrates but given Humphrey Bogart was in the cast the character is written more like Duke Mantee in The Petrified Forest He even has an English writer along in the person of James Stephensonbr br Kay Francis and John Eldredge are a pair of married doctors and Eldredge pulls off a tricky bit of surgery on one of Bogarts henchmen Bogeys a man who appreciates good work done on his behalf and gives Eldredge $50000 and theres more where that came from if he plays his cards right Eldredge who has a gambling problem sees a good way to get some undeclared income br br But when hes killed in a raid on the gangs hideout Francis is also thought to be involved by the law and the American Medical Association no matter how much she protests her innocence Its no good and she and her aunt Jessie Busley move to a small town to get away from the notorietybr br Of course the notoriety and Bogart and an itinerant Leslie Howard like writer in Stephenson all meet up with her again But Kay is plucky and resourceful to say the leastbr br Bogarts character was ridiculous no wonder the poor guy was screaming for better parts Hes a gangster who both shoots down people without mercy and gives his henchmen hotfoots just for laughs Hes concerned about his image and therefore kidnaps writer Stephenson to ghost write his autobiography and of course confesses enough to burn him in all 48 states And then lets Kay Francis completely outsmart him hard to believe he was king of anythingbr br Definitely one of the lesser works for either of the stars
This was the worst Wrestlemania in history The only good matches were Ricky Steamboat vs Hercules Hernandez and the tag title match between the British Bulldogs and the Dream Team (this one bordered on classic) Everything else was either poor or awful The idea of having three host cities was unnecessary confusing and messed up the fluidity of the show The celebrity guests were terrible on commentary especially Susan Saint Jamesbr br If youre interested in the mid 80s WWF youre better renting or buying Wrestlemania 3 or just about any other PPV for that matter
POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEADbr br Ill only say what hasnt already been said here (and Ill continue this for the rest of my WWFWWE comments)br br If youre going to have a Womens title match at least make it interesting rather than just a squash to put over the current champion I guess Moolah couldnt handle an intense match but they wanted to have the legend in a WrestleManiabr br I thought the Killer Bees were wasted in WrestleManias especially here I became a fan in 1989 about a year after the B Brian Blair was gone and Jim Brunzell became a canvas back So I didnt realize for a while that they were a top tag team even top contendersbr br But I loved seeing Bill Fralic in the battle royal He really came into his own here creating a cocky heel character in a pre-match interview and even making an elimination in the battle royal Besides Steve McMichael and Kevin Greene he is the only professional athlete from my generation with any respect for wrestling (anyone remember Dennis Rodman?) And what was with the Hart Foundations ridiculous green tights?
Wrestlemania 2 is the only Wrestlemania|thank god| to be held at three different locations and While it was an interesting idea it didnt really work There are only really two matches that really struck out with the rest being decent or most of them pretty terrible There are some entertaining celebritys on hand like Susan Saint James Ray Charles and Cathy Crosby but the experience was a waste of time for the most part The British Bulldgos Vs The Dream Team match is worth the price of admission itself but you can honestly see that anywherebr br Matchesbr br Nassau Coliseumbr br Paul Orndorff Vs The Magnificent MuracoW MrFuji For the time it had and despite the crappy finish this was surprisingly bearable stuff with the crowd being really into it Crowd chants Bullsht at the end That being said it did nothing for eithers career Match ends in a double count out with them fighting outside the ringbr br 25br br Intercontinental Championship Match Randy Savage|C| Vs George The Animal Steele Not that great wrestling wise but heavily entertaining due to the antics involved and some great comedy from Steele besides savage can wrestle a potato and make it look interesting Savage wins when he puts his feet on the ropes for leveragebr br 2 12 5br br Jake The Snake Roberts Vs George Wells For a throwaway match this was better than it should have been but its too short to make any impact what so ever Roberts wins with the DDT pulling out the snake afterwords which disgusts Saint Jamesbr br 1 12 5br br Boxing Match MrTW The Hati Kid&Joe Frazier Vs Roddy PiperW Lou Duva&Bob Orton A huge failure in my opinion I was bored senseless throughout this and while it may have been a marketing success it certainly didnt succeed at entertaining me Lot of Rowdy chants are noticeable as well T wins by DQ when Piper slams Tbr br 15br br Rosemont Horizonbr br Womens Title match Fabulous Moolah|C| Vs Velvet Mcintyre Ends too quickly before it even gets a chance to start making a record for quick pin fall as far as Womans matches are concerned Moolah wins when she takes advantage of Velvets missed splash from the top ropebr br 05br br Corporal Kirchner Vs Nikolai VolkoffW Classy Freddie Blassie Big pop for the Corporal Stupid match up with boring offense from both involved while being much too short to matter Corporal wins when he whacks Volkoff with Blassies canebr br 15br br Battle Royal William Perry and Andre get the biggest pops This is pretty entertaining stuff despite all the NFL talent involved Its also noteworthy for Bret Harts 1st ever Wrestlemania appearance Andre wins when he chucks The Hart Foundation outbr br 2 12 5br br Tag Team Titles British BulldogsW Lou Albano&Ozzy Osbourne Vs The Dream TeamW Johnny Valiant|C| Absolutely tremendous match that is one of the best wrestlemania matches of all time You wont have time to catch your breath with all the maneuvers on hand and the excellent in ring psychology This is pure wrestling at its finest you cannot call yourself a Wrestling fan if you dislike this match Bulldogs win when Dynamite Kid collides heads with Valentinebr br 45br br Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arenabr br Ricky Steamboat Vs Hercules Hernandez Pretty decent match up here with both men putting on solid performances Hercules is a nasty brute with above average skills and it contrasted well with Steamboats high-flying style Steamboat wins with a high-flying cross body off the top ropebr br 2 12 5br br Adrian Adonis Vs Uncle Elmer Terrible match with annoying comedy involved The fans love Uncle Elmer but I do not Adonis wins with a top rope maneuverbr br 05br br The Funk Brothers Vs Tito Santana&JYD Pretty solid match here with a lot of memorable bumps taken from Terry Funk|the one through the table was something else for that time| I would have to rate this as my 2nd favorite Funks win with help from Jimmy Harts megaphonebr br 35br br WWF Championship Hulk Hogan|C| Vs King Kong Bundy Decent pop for Hogan One of the most over-hyped matches in Wrestlemania history Hogan cant wrestle worth a lick and Bundy is not that great himself The violence was brutal for the time but Hogans superhero act is kind of annoying and there are too many boring moments Hogan wins when he escapes before Bundybr br 15br br Bottom line Wrestlemania 2 is a failure in most aspects Die hard wrestling fans should see this once but you really dont have too There isnt enough here to satisfy a true wrestling fan Vince blew it on this one Dont be fooled by the hype of the main event it really is a boring affair like most of the card Not recommended and ranks as one of the worst Wrestlemanias outside of the brilliant tag title matchbr br 410
Why do the powers that be continue to cast Jennifer Lopez in unbelievable roles? She was excellent in Selena and pretty good in Money Train which both cast her in roles where she could basically be herself However roles like this just draw the line I could never see Lopez as an FBI agent (see Out of Sight for that unremarkable performance) but as a psychotherapist? Give me a break!br br Basically Lopez plays the aforementioned psychotherapist who is involved in virtual reality experiments in which she enters the minds of her patients in order to help them sort out their issues When she enters the mind of a comatose serial killer to help save one of his victims she breaks all the rules to try and crack the insanity of his inner mindbr br Lopezs acting here is typically below average I cant get over that high-pitched squeak of a voice she has Shes no Julia Roberts but yet she comes across on screen as though she believes herself to be on the same playing field Well shes not even in the same stadium Sure she is a very sexy lady; however that isnt going to carry a film and it certainly doesnt carry this one With anybody else cast in her role for this film it would have been excellent especially if it was cast with someone who could lend more credibility to the characterbr br Having said all that this film is visually stunning The colors are fabulous and the story line isnt half bad in a B-movie kind of way The audio here is superb as well This movie gains some points for the fairly original storyline and major points for how it looks and sounds Unfortunately the acting and poor casting bring it down a few notchesbr br My Rating: 610
I love exotic science fictionfantasy movies but this one was very unpleasant to watch Suggestions and images of child abuse mutilated bodies (live or dead) other gruesome scenes plot holes boring acting made this a regretable experience The basic idea of entering another persons mind is not even new to the movies or TV (An Outer Limits episode was better at exploring this idea) i gave it 410 since some special effects were nice
If you like to watch movies because they are pretty you should be okay with this one If you like to watch movies that start out with a good guy trying to catch a bad guy then reveal clues to the motives of each throughout the movie skip it At the end of the movie i still didnt know why Stargher killed the women the way he did When you set up such a ritualistic serial killer it would be nice to know where the rituals originated from In Dreams was a similar pretty movie with a serial killer which also wasnt the best but at least the whys of how he killed the girls was explained They also hinted at a dark background for Vaughns character but didnt explain didnt really say why Lopezs child psychologist was so much better suited for this task than the rest of the people they interviewed didnt give much of an explanation for the little kids problem etc If the rest of the story is compelling I dont care about details like how Stargher afforded all the fancy electronic equipment and underground chambers or why the FBI wasnt checking to see if he owned any other property or had access to out of the way places while they were waiting to see if the whole entering the killers mind thing would work but I do like to have a sense of what motivates the serial killer in a serial killer movie when he kills in such a complex manner
As I said the idea itself was great and it had plenty potential I was truly sad of discovering that this was another typical American mass movie: We are in this for the money If only the producers had had more time to actually MAKE the movie This one was not finished when they let it out
I really enjoy this genre but The Cell was one of the worst movies Ive ever been unfortunate enough to watch While about 25 percent of my audience wandered in and out of the theater during the viewing (or left entirely) I was dumb enough to stick it out The main problems with this story (there were too many to list all) is that with this type of film you have to do two things one provide fear of the killer (being that they catch him twenty minutes into the film thats gone) and you must give the victim whose life is at stake (the girl in the tank) enough character development that you actually care whether they get to her in time or not Not only did I lose track of the girl I was given such little insight into her that she was only a blurry face and when I did remember she was part of the story I really didnt care what happened to her While the visuals were interesting in an LSD flashback sort of way they often times made no sense and this should be a lesson that visuals cant make up for lack of a good story (see Phantom Menace for another example) Finally does anyone know or care what was up with the women kneeling in that field and staring at the sky? Ridiculous
Im in a film class and i know that i dont know everything about film but truthfully this is one of the worst stupidest retarded and waste time movies that i have ever seen and i saw NAPOLEAN DINAMITE they are both equally terrible Conrack is boring and nothing interesting even happens in the film its not really a heart warming story and Pat Conroy overcomes nothing! Im not saying there should be fighting and crap blowing up but it would liven up this more than bland film the kids they fond to act in this film may have been the real kids from yammacraux island they sounded stupid and couldnt act as as far as i am concerned this was a stupid idea for a book and an even worse idEa fOr a movie I dont know why this movie was even made deviantly top five worst movies of all time
Not the best of the Lone Star series but it moves along quickly with good performances br br Introduced as Singin Sandy in the main title John Wayne as a singing cowboy isnt successful-- you never even see a front close-up of him while hes singing The actual singer is the directors son Bill Bradley who warbles away sounding like many popular singers of the day such as Hutch or Joseph Wagstaff br br The film features: Cecilia Parker (also seen in The Lost Jungle serial Tombstone Canyon and as older sister Marian in the Andy Hardy movies) doing her best Katherine Hepburn-- Really they mustnt; really Im not; Al St John before he literally became Fuzzy filling all his available screen time with his characteristic business of hat flipping head and chin scratching grimacing and gawky physical gestures and movements; George (pre-Gabby) Hayes as a gentle pipe smoking father; and Forrest Taylor minor vet of 395 movies and TV shows playing the oily villain with string bow tie and prop cigar br br Fun or odd moments: Yakima Canutts great under the stagecoach trick; the gay scene when Singin Sandy ties Bert and Elmer together face to face drags them roped to his horse and dumps them at Kincaids office where Kincaid says Youre a fine pair of lovebirds!; Dentons rapturous comment after an atrocious song and guitar playing performance by Sandy -- Ummm I could listen to that all night!; Kincaids reply We wont go into that after being told by a rancher Youve got the soul of a snake!; and of course he utters the immortal Ive made Denton an offer he cant refuse br br The plot of the movie is saved by Sandys tricking Kincaid and later saying the three magic words in many of these films: Im from Washington FDR has saved us from the Depression! (Is that why the villains are always either bankers or in real estate?) br br The shootout sequence is taken from the earlier Bradbury film Man from Hells Edges (1932) All of the Lone Star westerns are special because of their unique mixture of interesting characters the troupe of actors and stunt people and the spin on the clichés and repetitive back stories and situations This one ranks a little low marred by the inappropriate and mis-used Singing Cowboy gimmick Ill give it a 4
Riders of Destiny was the first of several westerns Wayne made for the Lone Star arm of Monogram Pictures between 1933 and 1935 In this entry the producers try to make the Duke into a singing cowboy called Singin Sandy Saunders with hilarious results Any Wayne fan knows that the Duke couldnt have carried a tune if his life had depended on it His voice was apparently dubbed by Smith Ballew whose deep baritone sounds nothing like Wayne Wayne looks awkward and uncomfortable in performing the musical numbers Thank heavens the singing cowboy experiment soon endedbr br As for the movie itself it contains a standard B western plot of the fight over water rights between the villain (Forrest Taylor) and the local ranchers Duke of course plays the hero He had not yet developed his on screen character and still looked like a poverty row cowboybr br Also cast in the film were George (pre-Gabby) Hayes as the heroines father Cecilia Parker as the heroine and Yakima Canutt as one of the boys who performs his falling from the racing horses under the wagon stunt while doubling Wayne Both Canutt and Hayes would go on to appear with Wayne in most of the other entries in the series Canutt in particular would have a profound effect on Waynes future development teaching him among other things how to move fight and look comfortable on a horsebr br As B westerns go this one isnt too bad however I have to give it a failing grade because of the singing
This is one of the worst films ive ever seen dont watch it even if your life depends on itbr br This Laurel and Hardy film is when they inherit an island become shipwrecked and are set to be hung An incredibly boring film that is no where near funnybr br This was the last Laurel and Hardy film and what a very low note to end such a superb career The 40s films werent great this film was made in 1950 If you want to remember Laurel and Hardy remember them in their prime the 1930s The short talking films are better than the feature length films my favourite is Me and My Pal Another reason this film is awful is because its dubbed The actor opens there mouth and the words come out three days later Absoulutley crap but lets end on a high note Laurel and Hardy have been in my opinion the best double act ever
I could almost wish this movie had not been made Stan Laurel was dying and it shows in his face even more angular and gaunt than usual A poor script and inept supporting cast
I never want to see this movie again!br br Not only is it dreadfully bad but I cant stand seeing my hero Stan Laurel looking so old and sickbr br Mostly I cant stand watching this terrible movie!br br Frankly there is no reason to watch this awful film The plot is just plain stupid The actors that surround Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are really really bad and Laurel and Hardy have been funnier in any of their earlier films! br br I warn you dont watch it the images will haunt you for a long while to come!
First let me start by saying that I am a Laurel and Hardy buff I have read every book printed about them and have seen all of their available films more than once I even took a chance once and called Stan on the telephone He was very kind and spoke with me for over ten minutes I followed with a letter and he wrote me a letter back I still have that letterbr br This film has some fine comedy moments but Stan and Ollie are not up to their usual form Stan was gravely ill during the production and looked worse than he did ten years later In my opinion any Laurel and Hardy film is worth seeingbr br But the Ultimate opinion of this film comes from the great Stan Laurel himself To quote him This film should never have been made
Atoll K aka Utopia is one of Hollywoods saddest swan songs Filmed in France The Land That Loves Lewis (Jerry) in 1950 and released the following year after a five-year layoff the boys are in truly terrible shape physically However they arent in nearly as bad a shape as the scriptbr br This movie is one of the un-funniest comedies ever filmedbr br Its painful to see this legendary team the funniest duo in the history of motion pictures the twosome that made The Devils Brother (1933) The Music Box (1932)Pack Up Your Troubles (also 1932) Babes In Toyland (1934) Bonnie Scotland (1935) Flying Deuces (1939) and so many more gut-wrenching laugh-til-you-choke classic comedies in a film such as thisbr br But fighters and ballplayers do it all the time They stay in the game one season or one fight too many In this case while is morbidly fascinating to see Laurel & Hardy at this late stage in their legendary careers they too stuck around for one too many
When the movie begins its obvious just how old and sick the boys are Although Oliver Hardy is enormous it is Stanley that looks like death warmed over Apparently he was deathly ill during production and had obviously lost a lot of weight Although he would eventually recover and live another decade and a half here he looks like a dying man Additionally as I watched the film I was shocked how many pratfalls Stan took--I half expected his to drop dead from the exertion I really cant understand WHY they came out of retirement considering their health--especially when the story and production values are as poor as they are with this film br br Stanley inherits an island and a boat He and Ollie are ready to leave when Antoine a stateless man is literally dropped into their boat and they begin their voyage to find the island Along the way they discover that Giovanni has stowed away but despite this the four men become friends and land on a different island It seems like paradise and they are all very happy A bit later a pretty young lady joins them and everything looks grandbr br Unfortunately uranium is discovered on the island and the place becomes flooded with riffraff Eventually the mob decides to hang the four men and take over--at which point the island sinks back into the sea and the men are sparedbr br I will give the film some credit for being original and for being interesting However one thing it is not is FUNNY--and that is unforgivable for a Laurel and Hardy flick While not a bad film it certainly isnt a good one A sad end to their brilliant careersbr br All the actors except for the duo are dubbed into English as the movie was made in France While it may not be the very worst film they made (this would be THE BIG NOISE) it sure is close!! Watching this film is painful and like watching people clean up after a severe accident
This movie was difficult for me to watch Stan looked very old and ill compared to what I remembered and Ollie was heavier than I ever recall in another film Most difficult though were gaps in the scriptproduction where I found myself wondering How did they get from here to there??? It took nearly half the film before I could deal with the dubbing of non-American actors -- that was also a distractionbr br Although I miss great actors such as Laurel and Hardy -- will there ever be great actors like those of the old studio era??? -- this film helps me understand why actors sometimes bow out in their prime
I just watched Atoll K-Laurel and Hardys last movie together and known here in the states as Utopia-on Internet Archive expecting to see some extra footage since the IA version had a running time of 2 hours and 21 minutes Turns out that its basically the same version I previously watched on the bargain basement VHS tape from Goodtimes Home Video that ran an hour and 23 minutes (with the exception of no product placement of the Welchs Grape Juice label being inserted when a bottle was shown) with the rest of the running time devoted to dark blank space While Stan does look like he might be dying anytime soon he still performs fine physical comedy with Ollie during much of the first 45 minutes or so Then the plot of taking a yacht with a stowaway and a man with no country aboard-not to mention a charming female French singer also coming to inhabit an uncharted island they all end up on-takes over with eventual complications that pretty much bogs the comedy down and never really recovers despite the familiar ending of Ollie saying for the last time to Stan Heres another nice mess youve gotten me into! before Stan cries uncontrollably before the fade out In other words if youre a die-hard Laurel and Hardy fan this movie is recommended for you to see at least once Anyone else wanting to get familiar with this classic comedy team should seek their earlier work they did for Hal Roach from the 20s up through 1940 when they completed their final Roach film Saps at Sea Come to think of it even some of the L & H Fox flicks (have yet to see the two they made for M-G-M) from the 40s are better than this oneUpdate-82909: Just watched some missing scenes that appeared in the Italian version on YouTube Cherie sings in one and has a conversation with the Captain In another that Captains wife pulls a gun on Cherie In one more Giovanni explains why he left his country with a flashback scene Stan is dubbed in high pitch here!
Oh why did it have to end like this? Laurel and Hardys last film from the crudely cranked-up Cuckoo theme (with erroneous credit to Hal Roach) to the closing Nice messI couldnt help it schtick this is the duo as a grotesque parody of themselves In between their relationship is now solely constructed of uncertain acting asinine dialogue and half-hearted slapstick People slate King of New York but Chaplins final bow-out was nowhere near as undignified as thisbr br What really hurts to someone who loves Laurel and Hardy is the appearance of the two comedians The video cover Im holding shows them at their prime all boyish smiles and glowing skin with a blurb on the back that reads The photograph on this sleeve is for illustrative purposes only and does not necessarily reflect the content of the film Necessarily? It doesnt even come close The actual film sees them at least fifteen years older than the photographs that adorn the sleeve with Ollie distressingly overweight This is not humorously or comically fat as he would normally appear but ill looking and on the verge of obesity He would be dead seven years after this film was made after a series of strokes Stan meanwhile suffering a prostrate problem and dysentery looks ghoulish as his weight has plummeted drastically Every time something bad happens to him such as getting squashed between a lifeboat and a table you fear for his life Even Ollie giving him a traditional slap makes you terrified he could be killed He would last for another fifteen years after the completion of this film eventually passing away from a heart attack in 1965 Its upsetting to think of such cherished performers growing old and dying painful deaths And its distressing watching their deterioration both in health and in performance on screen When I and Im sure almost everyone else likes to think of Laurel and Hardy I think of Way Out West Busy Bodies or Our Relations Seeing them in such physical ill health and performing dire routines at the dog-end of their career is a blight on my happy memories of thembr br The warning signs are clear right from the opening credits which list not only four writers but also someone to come up with the concept and a credit for gags So if Monty Collins was writing the gags then what were the other four writing? And in that case why was Monty Collins paid a fee given that theres no evidence of a single gag in the whole film? Over 40% of the movie is spent travelling to the eponymous island during which we experience some of the most painfully unfunny scenes the boys were ever involved in When I saw the bat scene I wanted to curl up and die so great was its childish ineptitude Yet what kills the film stone dead is that all of the support cast are dubbed unable to speak English Not only does this make the film disjointed but also it severely depletes Stan and Ollies reactions to their co-stars Flatly directed with appalling film stock and absolutely atrocious editing this totally belies the rumoured $2 million that was spent on it Frankly it looks terrible and while a DVD release might clean up the picture the sound and image quality is vastly inferior to any of their Hal Roach workbr br Stan and Ollies friends Giovani and Antoine are charisma-free bores who stand out greatly against Laurel and Hardys outdated repertoire This is another major problem with the film in that none of the supporting characters are funny or keyed in to the boys innocent mentality The dubbed harshness shown to L & H (you - the fat one) makes them stand out as isolated social misfits rather than loveable sub-anarchists There is evidence of some darker political satire - though Duck Soup this aint - and the concept of an island with no rules is an interesting topic Perhaps more relevant now than it ever was a film that looks at the problems of immigration and the American constitution suddenly becomes most topical in 2003 Sadly however beyond an amusing scene where Stan is elected the people this doesnt really go anywhere And this somewhat black humour does have its harsh edges - or is a Laurel and Hardy movie where rape is directly implied and Stan threatens a man with a bottle only to accidentally glass someone in the face your idea of a good time? After all the years of Stan and Ollie sharing a bed we also get a definite reference with Stan accidentally kissing him - Ollie wipes off the kiss in disgust Also worrying is the implication that Stan and Ollies illegal immigrant friend Antoine ends his life being eaten by a lion Mind you I never thought Id see a Laurel and Hardy movie where they were due to be hanged either The need for the intrusive and unfunny narration is a further pointer to how messy the whole thing is with the American release (the same version available on video) hacking out 16 minutes in a vain attempt to improve itbr br Almost completely unwatchable this horrifically made relentlessly unfunny movie serves only to tarnish the reputation of Stan and Ollie - avoid at all costs
OK so its not great either but only because of how great Laurel and Hardy have been in the past If this film received a total overhaul with picture quality enhanced add new dubbing to the badly dubbed voices and added a nice unobtrusive background music then this film would truly start to take shape As it is it does have its problems People do slate it for how old the boys look Quel surprise! they were in their 60s and had led a life However to me they still came across as having bucketfulls of charm and while this doesnt even come close to tickling the feet of their classics( I gave it a 4) its worth a watch simply because its them To think otherwise would be impostorous!!

This is not a movie This is a collection of random shots taken in a fascinating part of the world dubbed over with some random text The footage is not that great and the text is not that great either The end product is excruciatingly dullbr br On the DVD turning the commentary on can provide some entertainment value as the director makes a rather deranged argument that this is a sci-fi movie Its also fascinating to read about the extraordinary risks and hardship that the crew endured to collect this footage Too bad its rubbish But I think The Making of Fata Morgana would be a fascinating film sort-of like Ed Wood was
I find Herzogs documentary work to be very uneven Fata Morgana a companion piece of sorts to Lessons of Darkness lacks not only the harrowing spectacle but mostly the discerning eye of an author It is by comparison amateur looking aimless pans left and right across the desert the kind of which you would expect from any German tourist equipped with a handycam the camera left running from the window of a car picking up all kinds of meaningless images wire fences derelict buildings and patches of dirt going through the lens in haphazard order intercut with shots of sand dunes At one point Herzog encounters a group of starved cattle rotting away in the sand yet the image is presented much like you and me would perhaps worse the camera peering hand-held from one cattle to the next For a documentary that attempts to be a visual feast a hypnotic surreal excursion in uncharted landscapes it lacks the visual orchestration and conviction of a disciplined author Its all over the place half-hearted and tedious Mayan creation myths recited in voice-over then some other text Herzog fancied for literature Its not until near the end that Fata Morgana jumps alive through a series of bizarre encounters First with a man and a woman playing music in a room the man singing in a distorted voice through a mic both of them apathetic in their task A man holding up a turtle A group of old people trying to get out of some holes in the ground Other than that this one seems to have very little of substance to offer or visual splendor to offer

Of all of the post-1985 Perry Mason movies I have seen this one is my least favoritebr br I confess I have never liked Diana Muldaur as an actress She only seems to know how to play one type of character - a hard-bitten career woman with some undefined chip on her shoulder who for that reason is extremely difficult to in any way sympathize with This one is no exception - it runs true to formbr br The only thing that saves this movie in my opinion is an earnest performance by Scott Baio as the prosecutor - I actually found myself rooting for him to win and the movie is worth seeing for him alone
Despite the fact that the plot follows the well-known recipe of who did it which has characterised all the Perry Mason movies so far the characters of the present film are not so well-developed and the selected cast fails to give them flesh and blood Of course in general the Perry Mason movies are not significant but even for their low standards this one is weak
This movie was recommended to me by some academics From their comments I had some pretty lofty expectations But this movie was nothing but disappointing The aim of the director is obvious--to use an interweaving of speechespoems as a way to argue against the Bush doctrine But the director fails miserably at this Also I seriously question the directors choice of main character Its a bum who is definitely not worthy of being heard The rise of corporation power so what? Most importantly this movie gets a failing score in its persuasive power; its clearly intended for those whove already formed their opinions Its true that the movies aesthetics are quite pleasing But pretty much everything else in the movie simply sucks
I have read all of Shakespeares plays seen productions of a majority of them and even acted in and directed some I do not necessarily believe that Shakespeare must be done in the traditional fashion but I hated this moviebr br There is nudity that is gratuitous and unnecessary There is grotesqueness that is far beyond what I believe Shakespeare intended Some of the dialogue is incomprehensible and there are those elements like the singing and dancing that add no meaning to the movie but replace Shakespeare with the directors self-indulgencesbr br I am sorry to say that I wasted perfectly good money to buy the DVD of this movie
This was an interesting adaption of William Shakespeares last known solo play but in my humble opinion a terrible one Jarman tries to change the personalities of the characters for a start He makes Miranda seem insane after being stuck on the island for so long Prospero is no different - a mix of madness and self-pity on his part I could not imagine Shakespeare thinking his characters to be anything like the way Jarman portraits thembr br Calibans appearance is maybe the only thing he got right but then again I was under the impression that Caliban was a tormented deformed monster but turns out to be an insane rambling northerner who is constantly cackling not as I would have imagined him Ferdinand makes a brief appearance naked most the time and quietbr br In fact to the point I stopped watching this awful adaption their had been so many lines cut from the play If anything I think Jarman was trying to re-write Shakespeare and include his own scenes most the time So much text is cut out in the first part it makes it not a Shakespeare play but a load of 70s melodramatic preposterous rubbishbr br An attempt to interpret this play more realistically in the end but this play was never a realistic one and it was made nothing like the text displays it to be
I was loaned this DVD by the director of a film I am working with in which I play an actor who is playing Prospero Knowing his own style I did not expect anything resembling a classical interpretation of the textbr br What I have found is sometimes striking sometimes evocative but often meandering and tedious Like most experimental music I find that in films such as this the building blocks of powerful film-making are crafted even if they have not found their most useful form in a more coherent formatbr br Thus we have a Caliban who is more a clown than a threat and who not even Miranda seems terribly afraid of (which is odd since we know that he has attempted to rape her at least once) A Stefano and Trinculo who are more annoying than funny An oddly young Prospero who looks like Amadeus And a great loss of character development and plot through creative editing and highly stylized posturingbr br Interestingly enough I do not have an issue with the way in which Ferdanand or Miranda are portrayed His stunned rapture and her slightly freaky innocence are actually quite appropriatebr br I do not say that this is a bad film but an experimental one One that takes huge risks but is meant more for students of art and film and not really for anyone with an interest in the Tempest for its own sake
Derek Jarman has shown us time and time again that dialog is not his strong suit He is a painter and paint he does His films are almost always visually splendid but about as exciting to watch as paint that is already dry Watch his movies in fast forward the really fast setting that you can only get on DVD In The Tempest Jarman does very little with the script or the characters using them as simply a lattice to hang a very long and well-constructed cinematographic frame He even goes so far as to contradict Shakespeares original script to achieve these excrucriatingly slow and lifeless scenes There is none of the romance magic trickery or urgency the script calls for little spontaneity and the character of Caliban in particular is reduced to a quivering and insane idiot of sorts similar to Gaveston in Jarmans Edward II It is too bad that this is just about the only film version of The Tempest available
at first i thought nasaan ka man might be one of those progressive new filipino films as someone noted earlier the movie does not look poorly made its clear that the directors used more expensive cameras to shoot better angles better sound equipment good-looking actors and nicer locationsbr br however the improvements are all purely superficial if it werent for all the polish and expensive filters nasaan ka man would feel just like your typical second-rate local movie - - hyperactive drama predictable plot twists yeah right! moments crying screaming and characters you could care less about all shoved down your throatbr br a couple of things annoyed me about this movie first of all since when is it okay to have sex with adopted family? that not-blood-related argument does not make an ounce of difference second would a woman really not tell anyone for 40 years that she was raped simply because the father told her to keep it secret? and where the hell were the lights in this movie? i know the director tried to make things look super dramatic but i was simply forced to turn up the brightness feature on my TV set
This is one of four 1970s movies by TV writer Lane Slate about sensationalistic murders in small towns They feature likable TV personalities as police chiefs and quirky characters as town regulars including light-touch love interests The others are: They Only Kill Their Masters (James Garner 1972); and The Girl In The Empty Grave and Deadly Game (both Andy Griffith 1977)br br Aldas is set near Vermont (Mount Angel next to Horse Creek); the others in California Garners at seaside (Eden Landing) and Griffiths in the mountains (Jasper Lake) All try to capture the feel of a small town to move at a relaxed pace among comfortable characters and to tell a mystery with at least some complicated twist or turn to it On that level they are somewhat entertaining (that they were often re-run itself suggests they have some appeal) But they suffer from overall thin stories and dialogue slack pacing bland settings flat or exaggerated characters and off-putting forced attempts (often juvenile or crude) at color or humorbr br Aldas and Garners are the most serious about story characters pacing and tone They have the best supporting casts though Aldas is put to better use; the Griffith casts pale in comparison Aldas has the best directorbr br Shocking has some surprise and drama The killers method is inventive The tone is more even and the dialogue more natural than in Griffiths Aldas film does not suffer like the others from smug big-city transplants to the town or from hokey exaggerated local characters both of which come across as figments of a Hollywood scriptwriter not as genuine (the worst offender is the Griffith movies pipsqueak mumbling moron Whit who we are told tried to hook a jeep up to and make off with a trailer serving as a temporary bank branch dragged away the dock for the police boat stole tomatoes from a farmers truck only to get nothing for them and filled out $11 on the withdrawal slip of Spiro T Babylis only to be discovered by the teller) Mercifully absent is the clunky heavy-handed repetitive-style dialogue from the Griffith movies (You going to lunch? Im going to take out the boat You going to take the boat to lunch? Im not going to lunch Youre not going to take the boat to lunch?; There arent any fish in this lake Why are you fishing here? Its illegal in Horse Mountain Its posted here too youre breaking the law Some law There arent any fish in this lake Then why are you fishing here? I told you its illegal in Horse Mountain; Please call me Lloyd My name is Lloyd Okay Lloyd Call me Lloyd Thats my name My name is Lloyd)br br But Alda is too low-key and unimpressive to be taken seriously as even a small-time police chief certainly not a red-hot lawman in demand by a rival town Slate has the character admit as much when he comes late to the scene of a by then obvious clue as a result of an accidental name recognition Rather than detect or investigate Barnes strikes out blindly in emotional denial His secretary Lasser feeds him a key clue (Why didnt I think of that he says!) An embarrassing funeral scene plus a plot contrivance leads to another gift cluebr br Worse Barnes is more interested in deriding the military-style helmets of the county police sent to help him (Deadly Game also suggests Slate has something against the military) than leading them or his own men effectively He allows a late murder by incompetently guarding a known target Barnes allows his car to be repeatedly rammed by the killer fleeing one crime scene without drawing his gun or trying to take control Again he is ineffective and nearly killed in the climactic scene which results from multiple errors on his part that are only partially corrected by accident The erratic Northeastern accent that Alda affects does not help believabilitybr br There are plot holes Why would the killer strike after all these years? And committing the first two murders without a trace seems implausible But they are nothing compared to later ones -- a couple together a shopkeeper in his store during business hours a fully clothed deputy seated in his office and unbelievably his dog!br br Aldas movie also suffers from some offensive elements that Slate injects into all the movies Barnes first appears in a motel clerks bed He then treats her rudely at every turn and insults and tries to avoid her kids This and talk about the female doctor smack of a crude mean-spirited pattern (Garners film has been described as sleazy including a scene where he and a deputy laugh about how a girl in the back seat of a car that hit a bump in the road had part of her anatomy bitten off by a guy in the car with her Griffiths feature an ersatz Ropers routine in which the woman embarrassingly tries to coax the man into the supply closet; a gratuitous locker-room-type exchange with a deputy in discussing a young womans car accident death (Did you take her out? I took her in once); a reference to bank teller Bernice as swollen-up in places and to sticking a pin in her and to hating and firing secretary Maude because she was too hairy; a description of the female doctors practice as two stirrup tables and a flashlight; a humiliating scene in which Fran Ryan propositions Griffith offering some home grown; and an insulting subplot in which a woman pursued by a deputy played as a drippy buffoon seems to sleep around)br br Finally Aldas film has a grim bleached-out colorless lifeless look and feel Only Louise Lasser adds spark At least the other films had some spirit scenery and pleasant music; Griffiths got out onto the mountainside onto the lake and even out into the big city You feel more like re-watching Masters or Empty Grave than Shocking
Its been mentioned by others the inane dialogue in this series and I agreebr br If Mom and daughter were really that sharp-witted they should be Queen and Princess of the Universe not kicking around in some little townbr br Ive really tried to watch a few episodes but when the witty staccato mumbling pop culture drivel starts I flip the channelbr br I watched a bit of a new episode to see if anything had changed (for the better Id hoped) but nope same old were so clever with our references to pop culture that I nearly barfedbr br Long time fans who arent happy with the newer seasons might just be wising up and getting sick of the regurgitated pablum that never stops
I decided to watch this show and give it a go but I found it to be boring and more importantly dullDullbr br There is far too much sarcasm and the characters are all dull there is far too much talking and the character Lorelaijust keeps talking on and on and on During a second glance felt like suffocating the characters the banter doesnt work and the whole love and romance thing just ruins what is already a crap showI cant believe this show survived past the pilot This seems to be a show which forces the Listen to your parents lineNo actual drama existsbr br Should have stayed a pilotand a pilot alone
When I first watch this series the impression I got was that the characters were charming and funny Lorelai and Rory in particular were witty and intelligent conversationalist albeit a bit too talkative After watching it for some time however my opinion changedbr br The main characters slowly revealed themselves to be self-centered self-obsessed narcissists who treated tiny wounds to their pride as the worst insults in their existence For example Rory wouldnt speak to her mother for months when Lorelai didnt consult her on her impulsive marriage while Lorelai dumped Luke for simply wanting a little time to adjust to his new life circumstances These people are shallow see themselves as the center of the universe where everyone else should behave exactly according to how their own rigid rules and if they dont they will hold grudges against them for an eternity They dont want to see other peoples problems and treat the smallest slight as the gravest offence Most of the characters appear to lack the ability to behave in a grown-up way They think they should do whatever that they wanted and everyone else be damnedbr br The series is character-based so when the main characters became so unlikeable the show also became impossible to watch I still have the rest of the series but I doubt if I will ever finish watching them I will also hold anyone who think highly of the show and its awful characters with the greatest suspicion - they must just as horrid as Lorelai et al
I tired on several attempts to sit down and watch this program Gilmore Girls It baffled me for I just couldnt put my finger on what this was about Was this about a young woman having a baby young in life and never growing up? Was this about the daughter being more responsible than the mother? Was this about a rebellious rich girl and her non-rebellious daughter? What the heck is this show about? Finally I just didnt care The cast makes me want to scream The writing is neither smart or intelligent its syrupy and tediousbr br So why did I watch? Because I heard SO many good things about this and I am not one to voice an opinion until I have watched Knee-Jerk reactions are usually wrong so I watched a few times The first time I watched this I saw the mother running around like she was 12 and the daughter acting like she was 40 Maybe that is what didnt attract me I never liked any of the Freaky Friday films - not to say this is like that but there are some similarities br br Also I have a friend who watches this show every week So I asked her What is this show about? A very bright young lady usually articulate she never could give me a straight answer So I asked others who rave about it - they really dont know eitherbr br Gilmore Girls is turning out to be a TV program thats like an art house movie Many of us wont get it but those that go try desperately to find a meaning where there really isnt one just to be hip Yes I find Lauren Grahams Lorelai annoying - whine whine nasally WHINE A whole hour of that Wow And the rest of the cast is about as memorable as yesterdays cheese sandwich The town is hokey the men are wimps the grand parents are boring and sadly I find nothing redeeming about any of these characters or care about anything they do Its like watching paint dry on the wall
Usually when I dont see a show on an original run I find it later on cable and realize its a gem The Gimore Girls is one of those rare exceptions Im glad I missed itbr br I truly despise shows that fill every minute of the actors space with rambling stupid boring banter This is one hour of just that The mother Lorelei made me wonder if she is Bipolar and off her lithium She never stopped talking; every minute every second talking to every person she interacted with Worse yet her speech is childish and soooo like Valley Girl She talked about guys her hair her mother her clothes Like whats the sitch?? (for situation) Ive watched this show three times and still dont get the point of this series Its not a comedy its not a drama it has no point except to make three generations of females in one family look like the Girls from Planet Mars The males by comparison are smart and make the show somewhat watchable If Lorelei ever existed and attempted to latch onto me with conversation Id have to mace her to get rid of her She obviously doesnt know how to take a subtle hint to stop talking and start listening to someone else She also doesnt know how to really notice the existence of othersbr br In one show Lorelei comes home from a date close to 10 pm She got the date after pursuing a guy she met at an auction She goes into her daughters room where the daughter asks how it went She dithers on about how boring the guy was Her date somehow got a few words in edgewise Lorelei complained about how the man didnt stop talking (choke) Hopefully the date learned how fortunate he wasbr br One other person here commented on how the mother acts like a teen and the daughter is the adult personality Lorelei even dresses like her kid This obviously 40-something mom dresses and looks like she hit the mall with her high school pals in towbr br I thought that this show should have been followed by Just Shoot Me because thats exactly how I felt
This is an absolutely horrid excuse for a show People say its witty and intelligence? I dont see how? Maybe because the characters use fancy words? Maybe because they are snooty use dry humor and have 2 dimensional personalities I went to an Ivy league school and nobody acted anywhere near as obnoxious as these characters In fact had I met someone like them I would have likely strangled them! The men act like little emotional pre-teen girls and all the minority characters are based off stereotypes The characters are no AT ALL AUTHENTIC Simply put they sound like a trailer park family trying to be rich and sophisticated This show is just another cookie-cutter hit that brain-dead prime time viewers eat up on a regular basis
The preposterous premise of this flick has to do with Argentina reclaiming the Falkland Islands having failed through force in 1982 by impregnating the European women inhabitants with Argentinean sperm thereby diluting the ethnic purity until it favored Argentina Yeah right The reconnaissance is done by our herovillan and cad Fabian who hauls his fish-eye camcorder from pillar to post secretly filming his encounters with the Falklanders including his courting and eventual conquest of one woman Camilla An unfortunate indie and fraudulent documentary this flick favors us with lots of boring tourism shot from the hipyada yada yada The film has no plot potential and only begins to become interesting as Fabian and Camilla wend their way through the usual moments of awkwardness and uncertainty as they get from the handshake to the bed Fckland is only for those cinema purists who can appreciate the bleak no frills jigglecam austerity of Dogme indies
I will confess that once I started watching this movie it had a hold on me that forced me to watch it through to its conclusion Quite possibly this was some latent voyeuristic tendency in me that wanted to see our hero get it on with his victim or maybe fascination that they got funding to make distribute and show this film that kept me searching it for merit or possibly some bizarre wish-fulfillment fantasy that there might be a point at the end of all the pain But no such luckbr br So you are warned to not start watching it in the first place lest the same thing happen to you Theres nothing here worth wasting your hour and a half onbr br The first-person mockumentary and the schtick about Fabians quest to impregnate women of the Falklands comes out even more like a sophomoric (maybe Freshman - high school Freshman that is) film student project than you might imagine The effect ends up being both sneering at the local inhabitants (who other than the two professional leads are in fact real people) as well as engaging in rather disgusting sexual politics (no matter whether you take it all literally or symbolically its pointless and sexist)br br The reason I ended up watching it all the way is the same reason that once one starts to pick at a scab theres an irresistable fascination of continuing to do so until its completely off even when you know its bad for you You just want to see what happensbr br In the end this is rather dishonest filmmaking because it seems ultimately to have no moral center no elucidation of the local political situation nor any place in the type of political-sexual-personal film universe a la Goddard In short its got nothing to say and spends a long time pretending it does Smug would be the one-word taglinebr br Id suggest the filmmakers rent Waiting for Guffman a few times or hell even Blair Witch Project if they want to pursue the schtick with a little more style and a little more genuine emotion Or at least entertainment value
I watched Fuckland a long time ago I lied if Id tell that I remember it in detail; what I remember most vividly is the irritation it provoked me and the feeling of a total waste of precious money and time not only my time and money invested in watching the movie but also the directorsbr br Supposedly Fuckland is a critic of Argentinians presenting us (Im an Argentinian too) as little people who take credit for and even boast about petty ridiculous victories and think were the best thing that God (who is also an Argentinian) created Im not going to argue that Its probably a true statement about a quite big part of the population (the part I despise by the way) And even if this werent true thats not my point The worst sin Fuckland committed was to express such a statement about its own directorbr br The continuous impression I received was that the director was too busy trying to impress us for sneaking a camera inside the islands to worry about making a good (even a mediocre) movie Many of the takes made with a hidden camera are pointless The director chooses to show off with a silly edition of old war takes and his own ones And theres no plot at allbr br Moreover this movie proudly presents a Dogme certificate before the opening titles only to disrespect its principles afterwards (for example by including the director in the credits - another sign of his pride?)br br I found the movie offensive not as an Argentinian but as a watcher I felt underestimated Fuckland is simply one of the worst movies Ive ever seen
Now and again a film comes around purely by accident that makes you doubt your sanity We just finished studying the novel Northanger Abbey at school and decided to refresh our memory of this unexciting piece of humourless garbage with the BBC adaptationbr br The funny thing about Northanger Abbey is that it actually makes you want to kill yourself The film is NOTHING like the book for example the subtly evil characters seem to have been turned into transparent stereotypes John Thorpe looks like a leprechaun on acid while Isabella plays the role of slut Catherine the main character is the most depressingly stupid and irritating actress on gods earth (she looks like a coffee addict her eyes are like basketballs) whilst Mr Tilney looks and acts like a retired porno stunt double The plot goes completely off the rails at certain points of the film I dont know what the hell the director was thinking when for no reason at all a 7 year old black kid who weve never met before takes the main character out of the abbey and starts cartwheeling in front of her Yes thats right cartwheeling Nonsense of this kind is occasionally interrupted by Catherines fantasies in which she is being carried around a cathedral by an ogrebr br Northanger Abbey is basically visual euthanasia so if you want to murder your boss or something like that BBC have basically discovered a new way to kill someone Northanger is a barely laughably bad film Dont watch it unless youre in a padded cell
Awful dreadful terrible The actors are bad the music is ridiculous and the filming pathetic I rented the DVD and had to force myself to watch it until the endbr br My advice: read the book it is much better and you wont have to put up with all these silly images and ridiculous dreams Catherine hasbr br I think I have never watched such a bad movie
Ive seen some terrible book-to-film adaptations in my day but this one tops them all! The bizarrely unattractive cast detracts from the story which is in itself untrue to the book Mr Tilney is nothing like handsome; as for Catherine Morland a rat-like appearance makes this heroine a difficult one to sell to a sympathetic audience Isabella is nothing like the Aphrodite one reads about in the original text and James Morland appears in the film far too little to leave the viewer with any understanding of his important role in the story Also as others have pointed out before this novel was intended to satirize the Gothic craze prevalent in Austens time but it appears that this soft horror film was designed and meant to be taken seriously Im sure Jane Austen turns over in her grave each time one of her fans is disappointed by this awful interpretation of what was supposed to be a joke
We really dont know where to begin when talking about this movie But well start with the plot We sincerely suspect that whomever wroteproduceddirected this movie never read the book Because they missed the entire point SATIRICAL not horror Just a hint Second the bath scene Enough said Third the added characters The sketchy Gothic french lady and her black page who enjoys holding hands and cartwheeling We dont understand where this came from either And then there was the casting All of them were really unlikeable We were very upset that Catherine and Mr Tilney ended up together because they were so unlikable that no one would ever wish to see them happy Andthe music We think that the BBC producers ran out of money so raided their grandmothers attic And they found some old records Saxophone wailing female voices and an occasional electric guitar shudderbr br Plus the best line ever: Since you left the white rose bush has died of grief If anybody has any explanation we would love to hear it Because it makes absolutely no sensebr br We are still wondering what on earth everyone involved was thinking when they cruelly released this pathetic excuse of a movie out on the public We think it should be considered a federal offense Torture is illegalbr br This movie is by far the worst we have seen to date And Ive seen a lot of moviesbr br Our recommendation: Give this movie to whomever you hate They will watch it and want to kill themselves And we agree with a previous post we would give this 0 stars if at all possible DO NOT WATCH!! And we strongly suspect that everyone who commented so far in favor of this movie were involved in its production Or were mentally insane These are the only reasons we have been able to come up with that would instigate giving a favorable review
It is hard for a lover of the novel Northanger Abbey to sit through this BBC adaptation and to keep from throwing objects at the TV screen-in fact if Jane Austen herself were to see this she would be somewhat amused and possibly put out Maggie Wadeys adaptation has made Northanger Abbey into what it satirized the Gothic novel (and the readers of Gothic novels)br br The role of Catherine Morland in the adaptation is portrayed fairly closely to Austens Catherine a open-hearted generous girl whose imagination simply runs away with her But the Henry Tilney of the novel is not a snuff-taking cane-wielding sappy-line-making hero of a Gothic novel-he is a tease a nearly-handsome man with a messy room and a living (thats right Henry Tilney is a clergyman a charm that is completely dropped from the script) Some of the best scenes from novel when Henry completely deadpan outrageously teases the literally-minded Catherine on diction journals Mrs Radcliffe etc are not portrayed in the adaptation A large section of Henrys personality is lost when those scenes are not adapted Besides Peter Firths appearance is not accurate-Henry Tilney is supposed to be 24 or 25 dark hair and a brown skin not 35 or 40 and blondbr br There are so many other absurdities within the adaptation that invoke surprise and disgust-who is the Marchioness and what is she doing in the story?! Why is John Thorpe less of a dunce and more of a schemer? Why is Northanger Abbey a castle? Catherine of the novel with her romantic visions expects hidden passages and dark tapestries but is very disappointed to discover that Northanger Abbey is actually a comfortable modern house-another element of satire! Why portray General Tilney as a drunk? Why does Catherine have those strange visions of Mrs Allen threading her finger etc? Catherines imagination only runs away with her at Northanger with Henry there to correct her gently And lastly why are so many facts concerning the Tilney family and Mrs Tilneys death altered unnecessarily? To make the story more horrible? All of these oddities and more simply are too strange to be overlookedbr br  
This is a terrible movie that is barely recognizable from the book although they have sort of similar plots The time it takes to watch this movie (which is only 15 hours) would be much better spent doing anything else including watching grass grow The addition of poorly done fantasy scenes make Catherine seem insufferably silly The actress who plays Catherine also comes across ditzy as all goodness and looks constantly surprised even when shes supposed to be looking lovingly into her Tilneys eyes Honestly!! The movie ends with a Catherine fantasy-like scene where one cant help but wonder if its happened or if shes merely delusional and not in the good way that makes you think but in a perfectly horrible way that basically sums up the terrible movie The only good thing about the movie is the title which was written by Ms Austen herself I generally love the BBCs productions but this one is horrid
(This might have a spoiler)br br When I first started watching this movie I thought it was OK The music was good and that bizarro dream sequence I was willing to forgive but the lack of looks in the main character and all of the other characters for that matter made me uninterested in watching the rest of this film (I know totally vain)The music at the beginning was spirited and fitting I thought for a mock Gothic novel But come on! Saxophone music for an early 19th century film? It totally didnt fit This movie was totally boring and if youre looking to watch a good period film or an Austen dont rent Northanger Abbey! I give it a 30% 30% = a failing grade!
Poor Jane Austen This dog of a production does NOT do her wonderful tongue in cheek novel any justice Starting at the top  poorly adapted The screenwriter deserves extra low marks for trying to -- come to think of it I dont know WHAT she was trying for but suffice it to say she missed the mark by light years!! Couple that with all the over-acting and awful production values this is one adaptation that should never have happened It would have been far better if they just gave all the money they poured into this flop and donated it to a worthy charity Do yourself a favor read the book It is almost certain that you will enjoy it a thousand times more than trying to sit through this excruciating production!
Im afraid I did not like this adaptation When I started watching it I had a strange feeling of watching some 70s TV series due to the filter and the musical score I did not like the end scene Mr Tilney appears dressed only in his waistcoat Jane Austen would never have a gentleman ride out without a frock coat Looks like the producers made a modern misinterpretation of a romantic girls dream I appreciate the more modern JA adaptations much more that show an eye for these details that makes the BBC series so worthwhile Sorry looking forward to the 2007 adaptation I hope that will be better and will show the benefits of 20 years of Jane Austen adaptations
What an awful adaptation The worst part was the music Saxophone muzak and synthesizers playing in a story set in the early 1800s?????? The only character that didnt bore me to sleep was Robert Hardy I had to fight to keep my eyes open on this one and I love Jane Austen movies usually I didnt even rent it I borrowed it from the library They should have paid me to take it I dont quite understand how Catherine and Henry managed a passionate kiss at the end when throughout the movie they had no chemistry or indication whatsoever that they cared for one another Isabella and her brother were way overdone; it was no secret to me immediately that she and her brother were the bad guys and part of the excitement of Jane Austen movies is the discovery that who you think is good isnt This is probably on my list of the ten worst movies Ive seen
Northanger Abbey is not my favorite Jane Austen novel but it has its charms This movie doesnt It has some of the same character names as the book but the story is drastically altered and the sweetest man in the whole Austen canon (unless Emmas Mr Knightley gets pride of place) is made out to be a heartless and mercenary creep One or two totally extraneous characters are introduced and a palpable air of corseted perversion hangs over it all I was so disappointed when I first saw it on its release in 1986; even today it ranks high on the list of films that disgrace the books on which theyre based Even Robert Hardy fans should give this one a wide berth It has nothing and I mean N-O-T-H-I-N-G to recommend it
The filmmakers were clearly on drugs Thats the only explanation I have How else do you explain this travesty of a Jane Austen adaptation? Northanger Abbey is a parody of a Gothic novel But this film was made as if it WERE a Gothic novel The bizarre music and dream sequences to me suggest drug-induced hallucinations rather than a naive innocent girl with an overactive imagination as Catherine of the novel isbr br The actress who played Catherine just stands around bug-eyed all the time Peter Firth looks at least 10 years too old to play Henry and he actually seemed a bit on the gay side to me I dont see the attraction between him and Catherine John Thorpes portrayal was rather odd but Isabella actually wasnt that bad But nothing could save this PIECE OF CRAP movie! One more thing- This film invents a character not in the book a French friend of General Tilneys The Marchioness Why exactly they added her is beyond me Must have been the drugs She is scary-looking beyond belief with white foundation red lips and black lines randomly painted on her face (dimples?)br br Youd think this would at least be entertaining in a so bad its good quality but unfortunately its not Its just BAD
Shaky hand held cameras (this piece was shot for television mind you not film) not only keep you utterly conscious of how horrible the cinematography is in this film but make you absolutely unable to become immersed in the story Poor Miss Austen must be rolling in her grave All I can say is if you enjoyed the novel stop there until the BBC creates one of their smart & sensible period masterpieces (like Pride & Prejudice with Colin Firth which speaking for what I imagine in my opinion Austen would have revered) The BBC would never dare overdub cheesy saxophone solos and Indigo Girl hollers over a shot of an historic castle and a loving embrace Giles Foster seemed to be often confused that they were editing the music to The Specialist If you want Austen as you love her look for the BBC logo
The BBC and the Arts & Entertainment Network should be ashamed of themselves for foisting this unfortunate production onto the world The acting is with the exception of Robert Hardy as General Tilney amateurish at best and excruciatingly painful at worst The costumes are over-the-top and feature some truly ghoulish excesses -- was the costume designer obsessed with feathers for womens hats? Surely EVERY woman in Bath didnt have feathers in her headpiece in the early 19th century The production values are poor and the pacing of the film makes one feel it was hastily and clumsily edited at the last minute Altogether an agonizing film that I had to force myself to watch to the end Its a shame as the producers obviously spent a lot of money on costumes and location shooting Compared to Emma Thompsons sublime Sense and Sensibility or the extraordinary 1995 production of Pride and Prejudice or the subtle intensity of 1995s Persuasion this production of Northanger Abbey surely has Jane Austen turning in her grave
This movie started off well enough sticking to the mood of the book fairly well even if the acting was not top notch The soundtrack was torturously bad Saxaphone and electric guitars? It was gratingly incongruous The female singer was positively dreary! In the second half of the film the story takes a decidedly darker turn Too dark for Austen Northanger Abbey is made a dark and scary place whereas in the book it was disappointingly tame and modernized to Catherines eyesbr br Who in the heck is this Marchioness with the ghastly makeup and wig? A totally extraneous and unnecessary characterbr br One of the key elements in the book is the General is not a Gothic monster like the characters in Catherines books His monstrosity is far more complicated in his oppression of his childrens spirits and his treatment of Catherine based on money concerns alone He does not lock up his wife or kill her but he does send Miss Morland on a 70 mile trip alone in a hired carriage with not enough money to pay her way home Only her friend Miss Tilneys thoughtfulness in handing her some money on the way out the door saves her from being stranded This whole point gets seriously muddled in the film They make the General too dark from the outsetbr br Peter Firth should have not sung! This part was painful to watch His depiction of Tilney wasnt too bad but it was a shade dark in places Henry Tilney of the book made sport of Miss Morlands imagination on trip to Northanger but he was never dark Firth would have benefited from better direction The young lady who played Isabella needed a better acting coach John Thorpe was appropriately odious The striped waistcoat and coattails combo he wore was ghastly! It certainly fit his characterbr br I think the film would have fared much better with a completely different soundtrack It cast an oppressive pall over the entire movie If I watch it again it will be with the sound OFF and subtitles on Perhaps I would give the film a 4 thenbr br The sound quality of the DVD was quite poor The picture quality was not much better This is glaringly noticeable on a digital televisionbr br When I think of what this film could have been I think of Persuasion with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds
My mom my cousins and I are pretty big Jane Austen fans We know all the words to the 1995 Pride and Prejudice masterpiece and have watched Gwyneth Paltrows Emma an embarrassing number of times Ive read all the books and Ive even sat through Sense and Sensibility and Persuasion a few times So my mom and I thought it would be nice to see Northanger Abbey on filmbr br Bad idea! This is just about the worst movie Ive ever seen Its even worse than the 1998 version of Alice Through the Looking Glass or the 1939 Nancy Drew movie I bought at Wal-Mart for $1 (my previous worst movies) The first thing wrong which you notice in the opening scene is that the heroine Catherine has a gruesome and weird imagination inspired by trashy novels that a Jane Austen heroine would never touch Throughout the novel she has dreams (day and night) in which she is carried off by some hideous man with a greasy wig dragged across a field headed for God-knows-what-all and suddenly rescued by a dashing guy on a white horsebr br The second thing any viewer of the movie will instantly notice is the high-pitched wailing and saxophone music that is supposed to be the soundtrack No dainty classical music or English country dances here! It is also evident almost at first glance that the actress (for lack of a better word) chosen to play Catherine is completely off First she is rather unattractive and is rendered even more so by her un-Austenlike behavior Her looks and movements are just wacky! Plus theyre completely affected and unbelievablebr br This sad lack of acting skills affects pretty much all of the actors in the film Not even Mr Tilney the supposed dashing young suitor is decentbr br As more and more characters are introduced a strange taste in costumes on the part of the filmmakers becomes evident Huge Marie Antoinette-style headdresses clash with the (for the most part) correctly styled Empire gowns A French woman apparently a friend of General Tilneys is made up all in black as some sort of ancient Goth nightmare--she bears a striking similarity to Michael Jackson in a black dress Her appearance is made even sillier by a HUGE half-moon beauty mark on her cheek I also had to wonder about the historical accuracy of the bright red lipstick that almost all of the women were wearingbr br Another anomaly that kept my mom and I howling with laughter for about ten minutes was the bathing scene The first thing we noticed was that men and women were bathing in a big bathhouse together--probably not very likely in the early 1800s Then we saw that all the women seemed to be wearing large china or plastic plates worn around their necks with strings The plates floated horizontally on the water containing some mysterious pieces ofsomething We guessed it was soap then aromatic herbs then finally when the mystery substance began disappearing between shots we deduced it was food But Im still not surebr br And thats not even half of whats wrong with Northanger Abbey My warning to anyone who is considering renting this movie: stay your hand And if anyone is considering BUYING it--well I dont even know what to say to thatbr br Youd think that when the actors and others making this film got about 14 of the way through theyd realize what a monster they were creating and stop Unfortunately they didnt and Northanger Abbey was let out into the world
My first hugely disappointing BBCJane Austen flick The tone is off the costumes are off the hair is off the music is from outer space and Robert Hardy bless him looks like hes really annoyed to be in such a stinker Even some of the casting is off No I take that back a good director can make a silk purse out of a sows ear so to speak The performances in this thing are so over the top and melodramatic that its almost a farce of a Jane Austen story which is ironic since Northanger Abbey is a sort of homagesend up of the early Gothic novel I wanted to slap the female lead after awhile; who made the decision that she should be such a ninny? I had to watch Pride & Prejudice (95) immediately to get the bad taste out of my mouth Phew!
Is it possible to give a 0 out of 10 rating? Because this one deserves it While Im not a big fan of Jane Austens books I sat through this one with two women who are Well at least we had a big laugh about how bad this film is Robert Hardy was the only actor with any charisma in the whole thing though he overdid it as he usually does (nearly as bad as William Shatner) But that wasnt enough to save this stinker from total suckitude Its often hard to separate the girls dream sequences from what is really happening and so many holes are left in the story that you can barely figure out what is going on Too many loose ends and the ending feels like a tune in again next week climax The lead actress is too ditsy and weird-looking to be a heroine the leading man is too goofy-looking and effeminate to be a convincing hero and the music sounds like some kind of cheap new-agey pet project of the directors hippy daughter (I mean saxophone??? mixed in with some kind of spacey operatic female wailing?) So in conclusion I suggest you blow the budget and order a DVD of this one as soon as possible Especially if you like disappointment
Normally BBC productions of Jane Austen are pretty good but Northanger Abbey is just odd What were they thinking? This film has little of Austens charm and ironically mimics the Gothic novels that Austen so wonderfully mocked Not only that the gothic sequences are tacky over-the-top and frankly silly The actress playing Miss Morland is poorly cast with no obvious appeal to attract the attentions of an eligible bachelor and though I rather liked the creepy Peter Firth as Mr Tilney he is not a bit like the novel even when delivering dialog straight out of the book Robert Hardy as General Tilney turned in one of his few terribly ham performances This film was so bizarre and strange that I actually watched it again just to savor how freakishly wrong it was
Poor Jane Austen ought to be glad shes not around to see this dreadful wreck of an adaptation So many great Jane Austen movies have come out recently that this one deserves to be permanently buried along with two other movies I despise-The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit and the 1969 version of David Copperfield My main beef with the movie is that it completely misses the point of the book Jane Austen was poking fun at the Gothic mania in her society and much of the novel is tongue in cheek The movie however is serious and comes across terribly melodramatically The lighthearted fun-poking flavor of Austens writing is completely and conspicuously absent from this ponderous foray iinto horror meets period drama The scenes of Catherines imagination are both gratuitous and uninteresting Also Henry Tilney is dreadfully unappealing Why I ask would anyone fall for him? If you are looking for a fun-filled Jane Austen evening watch Emma instead!
Sometimes changes to novels when theyre made into films are not only necessary but a good thing However in the case of Northanger Abbey its a very very bad thing Not only is the story itself ripped to shreds but the satire is almost completely absent from the film and its mixture of romance and intrigue doesnt even touch upon the biting commentary that Austen put into her work It fails to be amusing or satirical at all and instead turns the characters fascination with her fantasy world into mostly a dramabr br This affects the romance as well Its meandering and aimless Chemistry and interest are never established The reasons Tilney is attracted to Catherine are completely absent from the film leaving the audience to wonder what it is he sees in her at allbr br Hopefully some day soon well get a more faithful version if Austens satire
In my opinion the movie was laughable--bad dialogue Whoever wrote the script--please keep your day job Its definitely NO Godfather or Goodfellas Its good to be on the otherside of the table--poor choice of words Some of the characters were clowns But what do you expect from a low budget movie with no name actors
Wow what a racist profane piece of celluloid garbage and what an insult to the great genre of Westernsbr br Exploitive? Sex scenes abound profanity abounds violence and gore aboundseverything that gives modern movies such a good name especially among those who prefer classic-era movies This is the kind of sleaze that gives the old folks ammunition against todays films br br Somehow I just cant picture nude male bathing scenes in Randolph Scott or Gene Autrey films Nor can I picture hearing motherf---er! exclaimed here and there I sincerely doubt that word was even around over 100 years ago Yet the f-word is so prevalent here youd think you were watching a story centered in todays urban areas not the old west of the 1800sbr br Prejudice? Well what if all the white characters were good guys and every black person was the nasty brutal villain? Do you think someone might complain about a racist movie? Home come we dont hear an outcry when the reverse - as demonstrated in this film - is shown in hundreds of theaters across the country?br br Mario Van Peeples wrote directed and starred in this bomb Remember that name Apparently he is the Ed Wood of todays filmmakers Even Spike Lee wouldnt be this racist You cant get much worse than this movie
This is the worst movie of ALL TIME! Its one of those that is so ridiculous and the acting so bad that you turn off the video 13 into it so that you can use your time for better purposes like cleaning the toilet If you actually watch the whole thing GOD help you
Its not just that the movie is lame Its more than that This movie is just unnecessary Do we need another Western? How about a western with afro-Americans in the titles roles? Sound stupid implausible and a lame attempt at modernizing the genre? It is Incredibly lame and simple minded Its like that lame Baz Luhrman film Romeo and Juliet where he set it in modern times to attract young folks and create some hype with his revamping of a classic tale Well Baz Luhrman failed miserably and so does this mess The story is actually not bad however the whole idea of removing the racism out of a racist genre by casting an all afro-American cast is racist in itself Its also puerile and simple minded (like Baz Luhrman-man hes a bad director) Hey (I hear you say) this was directed by Mario Van Peebles! Hes also IN the film! How can it be racist? Its not I said the idea of casting all afro-Americans instead of Caucasians was The film isnt racist its just pointless stupid and very very boring
This move is bad on so many levels I dont even know where to start OK - the good points - Peebles is beautiful as a dirty outlaw in black leather Some of the landscape photography was stunning Thats about it Oh and it was a nice touch having the buffalo head above the bar door in Freemanville I figure it was a nod to the Buffalo Soldiers The movie starts sort of OK but the characters are so flat so comic book so much the bad guys are just over the top bad I choke trying to describe them further The Spanish-Cuban-American war was 1895-1898 with America being involved only in April to August of 98 I think the movie said it took place in 1893 (I could be wrong but I dont want to look at it again to check) A big part of this movie hinged on the KKK killing Jessies daddy Well boys the original KKK started in 1865 and was destroyed by President Andrew Johnson in 1871 The Klan wasnt even around during the time period of this movie Of course the nasty basrds got busy again in 1915 and we know the rest of that BUT for the purpose of the movie it is historically incorrect and that was a major part of the plot I think I could make myself crazy going into it a lot more so here a few jabs and Im done I didnt know that Boyz2Men and other bands like that got their inspiration from New Orleans street singers from the 1890s I also didnt know that fetish necklaces were all the rage for Sioux women in the 1890sbut then I was surprised to see a bar singer doing jazz while wearing acrylic 1 nails We just about died laughing and I like a cheesy western more than most people do Such a waste of talent and money - this really had the chance to show a part of American history that isnt well known http:wwwcoaxnetpeoplelwfbkcwboy2htm for some more information This could have been so good but it was justbad from 1-10 this gets a 1 instead of a zero because Mario looks good in his hat and there was an Appaloosa horse in the film
An awful film; badly written badly acted cliched hackneyed dross The premise is such a good one and a chance to educate about black cowboys but the film is truly dire It is a curious mix of a bad 1950s Randolph Scott B movie and a bad 1970s spaghetti western The villains are cardboard the flashbacks laughable the dialogue excruciatingbr br The deliberate anachronisms (such as Victorian rap singers and modern swear words like motherfer) are irritating to the extremebr br A Frankenstein monster that died on the lab table
i think south park is hilarious and i have no problem wthem taking shots at people on the left but youd think that after taking a whole movie to attack celebrities for risking their careers taking on an illegal war and then being GASP right along they would have the sense to start giving w and the bastards ruining the country a shot or two bush seems to get a pretty free run from these guys for as stupid and messed up as he isbr br gore is fair game but please what do the republicans have to do how bad do they have to f^&k up the country before these guys finally act like maybe they arent just trying to do the best they can and that they have done some true screwing upor maybe just go after rush limbaughhes a good targetor even just make fun of condoleeza rices gap teeth
CHOMPS is very much like any number of cheesy late 70s Disney family comedys-The Cat from Outer Space or Unidentified Flying Oddball for instance Utterly devoid of anything creative beating the same cliches to death yet vaguely entertaining in a mindless sort of way The actors wont win any awards nor will the director writer or FX crew but in its inoffensive ness and bland predicatability there is some vague entertainment to be had The idea of the robot dog as security system is so full of holes you could use it as a colander The incredibly repetative disco soundtrack will stick in your head so beware
For a scientifically-engineered super-dog that was supposed to be the answer to petit crime CHOMPS was a chumpbr br All I ever saw Chomps do was sit or walk or run Or run then walk then sit and then get back up again and stretch and then walk and then jog to K-Tel dance hits And sometimes it had all the answers to the daily Jumbo But mostly it just sat a lotbr br All I am saying is: In a Celebrity Death Match Chomps couldnt take out Mr Bigglesworth
My God the things that passed for entertainment in this countrybr br This is not the Tom and Jerry you may have enjoyed on Saturday Mornings featuring a hapless cat and a clever mouse This is a much earlier animation series featuring a pair of Mutt-and-Jeff clones who get themselves into various scrapes that result in any of the then-typical dancing-skeleton-type gags that made up so much of early animationbr br This particularly vile outing apparently originally intended as a vehicle for a pair of actual black stage comedians of the time has the pair crashing in the ocean while flying to Africa necessitating black-face make-up exaggerated negro dialect and Feets dont fail me now situationsbr br It only shows that in the 70 years between emancipation and this film the American view of Africans hadnt progressed much Then again at least one of them apparently had a pilots license
I was under assumption that this was the cat and mouse duo but it wasnt instead it was something that shouldnt have been made not even for its time They disguise themselves in the blackface fashion because they fly to Africa and they even act like Stepin Fetchit and all the others rolled into one There are some cartoons that are racist but they are classics being a mixed woman I have the right to say this but if you are into the historical aspect of these cartoons try Merrie Melodies Coal Black and de Sebben Dwarfs or Angel Puss you wont find them on DVD because the distributors promised not to put them in the mainstream but you can find them on a site as YouTube I dont recommend little kids seeing this but if you want to see how early America was racist and ignorant these are better suggestions not to mention this particular cartoon has poor animation i know it was 1932 but I have seen better for its timebr br Plane unnecessary -1 out of 10
Tom and Jerry are transporting goods via airplane to Africa But being white men theyre worried they wont be safe so they put on blackface to fit in Once theyre wearing it they adopt black dialect and fully inhabit their new characters They crash into the ocean and use the wing of the plane as a raft Before reaching land they suffer the advances of an over-affectionate octopus and more serious danger from sharks a swordfish and a whale Once on land theyre frightened by fantastic creatures and duck into a cave Inside its even worse when they encounter living skeletons in blackface And upon exiting the cave things are even worse than that when they are discovered by cannibalsbr br Plane Dumb is an especially sloppy effort from Van Beuren Studios One example: a lion unknown to Tom and Jerry enters the cave before they do But the animators must have forgotten about it because the lion never appears again Another example is the ending thats not an ending: its just an arbitrary stopbr br According to a YouTube poster the cartoon was originally intended to feature the voices AND caricatures of a popular Negro comedy team known as Miller & Lyles But Aubrey Lyles died of tuberculosis before the recording session was completed and co-directors John Foster & George Rufle were forced to rework the animation into a Tom & Jerry storybr br They shouldnt have bothered The crude animation and poorly-executed gags make the film a loser from beginning to end
While credited as a Tom and Jerry cartoon this is not the cat-and-mouse team but an earlier Mutt-and-Jeff rip-off featuring them going to Africa and disguising themselves in the stereotypical burnt cork makeup to try to blend in While the dialect humor is mostly lame there is a brief musical sequence involving black skeletons that was entertaining I have to ask however how could Tom and Jerry still have their makeup stay on even after being dumped in the water a couple of times? One of many entries produced by the Van Beuren Corporation for distribution by RKO Radio Pictures before RKO made a deal with Disney Only worth seeing if youre an animation buff or is interested in how certain ethnicities were stereotyped as entertainment way back when
Tom & Jerry are visiting Africa and disguise themselves in an Amos-n-Andy fashion They even act and talk differently with the standard degrading usage of extremely poor grammar associated with the stereotypical image of blacks portrayed in many cartoons of the era Aside from the offensive images this cartoon just isnt very good Why were they going to Africa in the first place? Apparently just to provide the audience with another Amos-n-Andy and the additionally overused cannibalistic portrayal of native Africans The only reason this got a 2 instead of a 1 was there is a decent few seconds involving an octopusbr br Worth one view which will still leave you shaking your head wondering how ignorance could prevailbr br (Note I consider some cartoons containing such racially stereotypical images very good It all depends on if there is good content surrounding the cartoon or if the only reason for the existence of the cartoon is to make fun of those incorrectly portrayed In other words if you get rid of Mammy shuffling feet the poor grammar and black-face with giant lips images is there anything left? In the case of Plane Dumb there is not)
Dumb is right: Tom and Jerry reach their goal of a non-stop air flight to Africa but then worry about mixing in with the natives They put on blackface crash the plane try to survive on an airplane wing floating in the ocean and then survive the wild animals once they get on landbr br Having read a few reviews before seeing this I knew what to expect It was simply these two guys doing their Amos and AndyStepin Fetchit impressions Offensive to blacks? Of course but thats the 1930s for you Some of their lines were funny some were stupid The main fault I had with this cartoon was the audio as it was often not easy to understand what these two guys were sayingbr br In all a curiosity piece but dont let the racism stop you from checking it out At least it gives you an idea of how times have changedfor the better
This was not a very good movie the acting pretty much stunk and the effects were bad most of the time But there were some funny moments but most of those were not meant to be funny The most hilarious part of the movie to me was the part were a little kid in wheelchair falls out (thats not the funny part What kind of person do you think I am)anyway the kid falls out and starts screaming for his big brother well the brother comes running and the way the kid runs is so funny hes all stumbling and really over acting I had to rewind it several times so I could laugh some more so if your looking for something to rent but just cant seem to find anything check this one out and watch for the running part
Someone else called this film a fable-horror movie and I think that fits pretty well Thats the concept at least A group of teenagers each with their own vice catch the eye of a twisted sideshow barker He decides to teach the teens a lesson by making them part of the freak show A cool idea but could have been executed better The fate for some of the teens is shoved in your face too obviously while other characters could have been fleshed out more Also the ending was a serious let down No resolution or big twist or anything br br But as a low budget horror movie its pretty fun to watch If youre into cheesy spookfests you should have a laugh watching this one I think one of its faults though that it takes itself too seriously Its a silly movie and if it was a little more self-aware when it comes to that I think it would have been better But at least theres enough neat carnival themes and b-movie monster makeup to keep you watching
Sideshow is a good example of a basically interesting idea gone very very wrong As far as horror movies go and especially with the influx of teen movies at the moment a film based around a bunch of teens attending a mysterious freak show is something you could have a lot of fun withbr br However the writer decided to make a very straight very boring very plain tale about five teens who become part of the show when enraged midget Abbot Graves transforms them into freaks using some pathetic machine that mutates them into beastsbr br The five teens are picked off one by one until the last guy is left his punishment being that he is unable to join his friends and thus be alone What a load of rubbish! br br The actors are really poor this film has no comedy (and it could have been so funny!) no gore (and it could have been so gory!) no action and no horror (and it could have had so much of both!) br br The director has failed in his duty to even try to make this a little interesting to watch His experience in soft-core has obviously disabled any creativity he may ever have had as all the shots are the same with very few edits and little movement The quality overall is poorbr br Im not usually swayed by nudity in movies but believe me the only high point in this film was a pair of breasts
Stay away from this movie Far away Phil Fondacaro stars as the demented ringleader of a Freakshow Every performance is flat and unfeeling except Fondacaros The plot is a simple one and follows almost every horror movie cliche possible A group of high-school kids go to a carnival see a side-show and get in over their headsbr br Fans of Fred Olen Ray should be warned this is not like any of his other films This one is lacking in all departments (humor sex horror etc) other FO Ray movies excell inbr br The version I saw also contained a Making-Of documentry in which the director makes comments like We had a limited budget and with our limited timeline which speaks volumes about how much Charles Band cared about this film Go rent Droid Runner (Fred Olen Ray) or The Dead Hate the Living (Full Moon) instead Full Moon should be ashamed of themselves (and thats saying a lot after seeing Killer Eye)br br Grade: D-
this could have been betterbut it was alrightit helped me get away from my boredomI didnt even wanna see itthe only reason i wanted to rent it is because Jamie Martz is in ithe is a unknown actor but he is shining and is the highlight of the moviethe ending was so horrible and the acting was good for a b moviei give it a 4 out of 10
This is absolutely beyond question the worst movie I have ever seen It is so bad in fact that I plan on renting it again as soon as I can find it This movie makes Plan 9 From Outer Space look like an Oscar contender Just LOOKING at the actors makes me want to laugh out loud I cannot say enough bad things about this movie Its awfulness aproaches perfectionbr br The plot is based on a terrorist attack with a nuclear weapon in San Francisco (I think) Thats as far as I can go  I am laughing too hard I know it shouldnt be funny but  LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLbr br MOVE OVER ED WOOD !!!br br Regards DATo
Im Mike Sedlak I co-wrote the score for this movie And proud of it br br And I love all of the comments Some have not gone far enoughbr br The movie premiered in San Francisco in the summer of 1973 The theater was packed with friends and family We all clappedbr br Five days latter it was pulled from all of the screens in the Bay Areabr br If anyone is interested hearing some of scene by scene details which might make the movie even more enjoyable please let me knowbr br We could start with the shot where Gideon Blake throws the toilet plunger to distract one of the evil henchmen guarding the radio transmitter on the deck of Buds house br br Or how Gideon diffused the bomb in the original versionbr br Didnt help It still bombedbr br Bring it on
I was greatly disappointed by the quality of this documentary The content is poorly produced very poor quality video and especially awful audio Theres extremely little about how Bruce Haack produced his music and virtually no examples of direct connection to later and contemporary electronic music The interviews of people who knew Bruce Haack are ad-hoc mostly inarticulate mumbo-jumbo Too much yak and not enough Haack Although I have a serious personal interest in electronic music and have a higher than average attention span even for slow andor difficult subject matter I fell asleep while watching this documentary and had to review it to see the parts I slept through If you watch this make sure that you are set up before viewing like Alex in A Clockwork Orange Bruce Haack deserves much better than this Shame on the producer and director
I dont understand why so many of the comments here seem to indicate that this is acceptable entertainment The eye-popping horror of this cinematic monstrosity cannot be overstated Me and my girlfriend just watched it together and Im not sure well ever be able to have sex again Im not sure what was worse the scrawny unattractive cast their supremely unphotogenic genitals the rancid attempts at humor the screeching noises that claimed to be songsbr br No I know what was worst of all The girls in the green leotards with green facepaint licking Alice to dry her off then proposing in broken childlike speech that they suckle milk from her breasts That was the worstbr br Also what was with the nurses and why do they seem to have so much trouble finding each others vaginas? Why are all the male actors gay? Why does Humpty Dumpty waggle a dildo in the air and pretend that its his penis? Why did my eyes have to see this? There are no words
Maybe if you smoked enough weed this would seem funny or would make you nostalgic for how completely unhinged people allowed themselves to be in the early 70s Theres an odd innocence to this movie and the sex is a lot more awkward and playful than the steely pros who do it for the cameras nowbr br The real curio here - and really the only reason to watch this movie - is the appearance of Kristine Debell as Alice She was a Ford model and it shows Shes got classic WASP-ish good looks - like a really cute Ivy League sorority girl So what the hell is she doing in this cheap cheesy skin flick? From my vantage point she does not appear to be at all on drugs in this movie (which might explain it) and she actually seems incredibly committed to the part When she sings her first song she really does act like she thinks shes flippin Julie Andrews or something I just get the feeling that this girl truly believed this was gonna be her big break or something instead of the near career killer that it was Anyway she is damn cute and you kind of cant believe she would even get naked on screen much less do a masturbation scene a couple of oral sex scenes (with men and women) and then do the real deal as a climax to the film (snark) It is also definitely not a body double at all That is our little Kristine taking one for the team or for the greater glory of showbiz or something Its pretty amazing to watch and it is definitely stimulating (ahem) but in a way I kinda wish she hadnt done it That was a very pretty talented young girl getting some really bad advicebr br Anyway my guess is that Kristine Debell wherever she is has long long since wished this movie would go away She was very cute and appealing in Meatballs Almost impossible to believe this is the same girl - but it is
Oddly I have very little to say about The Box so this will be pretty brief I have never read the Richard Matheson novella Button Button from which the film is based but considering what I saw in this adaptation there couldnt have been much semblance to such a legendary authors work The Box is about a family who discover a strange contraption on their doorstep that has a button on it Frank Langella shows up and explains how they will be given one million dollars if they push the button - the only catch is that it will automatically kill someone somewhere ??SPOILER?? They push it ??END OF SPOILERS?? That whole concept was interesting on its own but somehow they managed to extend the movie into some convoluted Stargate knock-off that pads it out until a pretty decent ending with a pretty profound message While Im trying to be as fair as possible I still must say that this was not my cup of tea and it bored me severely I guess its from the same director as Donnie Darko which I remember liking when I saw it years ago The Box wouldve worked well as a short film but since it was so lifelessly adapted this way I cant come close to recommending it
This is a flic that you can safely avoid childish plot and poor acting from Cameron (she really shouldnt take on these serious roles - they dont suit her)Besides she looks most unglamorous Lets face it shes great in Charlies Angels and She was superb in Theres Something about Mary The Pope wouldnt be a good President of the USA and vice versa my point being that there are some actorsactresses who are suited to a particular type of character and Cameron is most unsuited for this serious housewife type - there are a dozen other actress would have done a far better job The movie itself is rather unbelievable and juvenile in its plot (did I spell Juvinile right??) I noticed a comment from another reviewer who has given The Box a 10 rating who was derisive in his comments on other reviewers who gave the movie a 1 or 2 rating and couldnt spell I mean whats spelling got to do with a movie review? Does he mean that persons who spell perfectly could appreciate this movie more that the ones who couldnt? Cmon professor
The Box is a film with great potential but the makers totally misused that potential The film seemed to take for ever because of the boring family dinners and scenes about school and job-dialogs between the action Those scenes could and must be deleted in my opinion to keep up the tensity and thrill The philosophy of human free will has potential and seems to referring to the philosophy of Thomas Hobbes (1588-1679) but we find ourselves regretfully struck with magic and nosebleeds were even Harry Potter would flunked his class with!br br Probably the best part was that moment when Norma Lewis (Cameron Diaz)has been shot to death by her loving and caring husband as an act of human free will I wonder how Hobbes would react if he could
How truly sad that this sprung from the same mind as Donnie Darko possibly one of the best films in this genre Where do I even begin? I think one of the must infuriating aspects of the film is that we are supposed to be critiquing humanity and yet we see no humanity in the film No more than 5 minutes of the film is spend agonizing about the possible death of another human These are horrible one dimensional cardboard cutouts of human beings Sadly thats how they are played with what can only be described as dreadful acting Is this truly how Kelly sees humanity? Judging from the reaction of viewers this is a horrible encapsulation of humanity Why dont the characters in the film ask the questions that all the viewers have? This is not an indictment of humanity Its an indictment of the straw men that Kelly sets up who bare almost no resemblance to real humans in this situationbr br To those who say this was a wonderful thought-provoking film to what are you comparing it? Armageddon? I even saw someone compare this to the works of Kurosawa How truly deprived must you be to think that this would promote good existential discussion? For the love of all thats good in film! Even Indecent Proposal is ten times the indictment of humanity that this is There we see people truly agonizing about greed and the human condition Yes even Indecent Proposal puts this film to shame for philosophical discussion and yet it gets 53 vs 60 for this mindless tripebr br Rarely have I seen a more pretentious pontificating and self aggrandizing film fall so flatly on its face This has the depth of a high school film project and a poor one at that Truly thats about the level of the discussion promoted by this film If you want to see GOOD psychological film making do yourself a favor and check out Das Experiment If The Box had lived up even to this one goal I would have been willing to forgive some of the atrocious acting gaping plot holes and sheer nonsensical storyline Sadly it cant even do thatbr br The true indictment of humanity is that there are people out there who think this film is a deeply delving introspective look into the human condition This is not Sartre! This is not even the Cliff Notes version of Sartre! This is a hastily conceived and hack-written 9th grade term paper on Sartre based on some internet message board ramblings If Sartre were alive he would sue Kelly for defamation
First of all Should Cameron Diaz ever be allowed to act again? To call that a bad performance would be an insult to bad performances That was a historically horrific performance Any small chance that Diaz had at being a serious actress is now completely done after that Laughably horriblebr br Two the movie was extremely boring and not very thought provoking at all I can sit around and ponder human nature without having to watch terrible actors play out a terrible storybr br Third there was not a single likable character and even worse it seemed like that was done by design You were not supposed to like or feel sympathy for any character It was quite effective I wanted them all to just die to be honest Aliens included Kid included Everyone was just one big mope in this movie Everyone literally just moped around and they called it a movie You could barely distinguish the zombie employees with regular people because they all seemed like zombiesbr br Lastly nothing really makes sense From the characters reactions and emotions to the literal story line it all just seems random This is just a really bad movie disguised and couched as a thinking mans movie which is meant to be confusing Give me a break A bad movie is a bad movie And this movie was bad
Dont be greedy sums up the depth of this movie All the rest of the baloney is big budget window dressing The movie rotates through hiding the ball annoyingly and revealing too much None of the potentially interesting plot tangents are developed yet the trite ones are hashed and rehashed to excessbr br The charm of DD as others have pointed out was in the schizophrenia devicethe humor woven into the fabric of the movie and most importantly the acting There is enough wooden acting in The Box to attract a giant mound of martian termitesbr br The biggest problem with suspending disbelief during this mess is the glaring question why would a technologically superior power capable of taking over the government need to do any testing at all? Awful failure of a movie
Cameron Diaz James Marsden Frank Langella: thats an all-star power cast but The Box proves once again that it is not a guarantee for a solid movie The premise sounds promising: a couple gets a visit from a mysterious person who offers them a million dollar The downside is that someone will die a person they probably will not know So What Do You Do ? This gives us an interesting story for about 30 minutes After that the story derails completely Vague an uninspired plot lines about an alien conspiracy involving the NASA nothing really is explained here br br The Box is a disappointment could have been so much better But since it is based on an ultra short story that explains the continuity errors
This is my first review on IMDbcom and probably first ever written review of a film Ive done of my own accord - not for some class assignment I think that fact alone says something about this movie not a good thing! I am no seasoned journalist or critic (though I have seen my fair share of movies) but I found this particular film so terribly painful to watch it was necessary for my own peace of mind to vent about the experience Where better to do it than IMDb? As I forced myself to sit through the movie physically writhing from the inability to connect-the-dots I was sure there would be some light at the end of the tunnel - a revelation to explain what in samhe-ll was going on The movie ended and I was as enlightened as dog After several rewinds to review certain scenes I still could conclude nothing sensible I found myself wanting to yell Does this make sense to anybody? I would recommend to not waste your time but then again if I were you Id probably want to experience it myself If thats the case bring a crossword puzzle or something so you dont get bored
quite possibly one of (if not the) worst film ever conceived cast and acted in the history of cinema Who on Gods green earth would ever think to cast Cameron Diaz and James Mardsen as a couple? She looked like his mother God forgive me but I am just being honest And that was the least of the many problems plaguing this horrible excuse for a film It was a horrible statement against women but at least if youre gonna blame women for the problems of the world tell a decent story not one with so many annoying loop holes and pathetic excuses for suspense and thrills Everybody should get their money back who went to see it in theaters or bought the DVD
I like to like movies but I found nothing to like about The Box I was interested in the hook of the plot but unfortunately it never went anywhere and was impossible to follow Anyone who states that they understand this movie is probably faking it so that they can feel like they are a part of something well I have news for them the emperor has no clothesbr br The only undertone in this movie is that women are to blame for original sin and corrupting mankind Ive heard that story before and it makes less and less sense every time Its true that this movie is different than a lot of films currently showing in theatres but that doesnt make it worth the ticket price
Now this movie is the worst i have ever seen!! It is simply a disaster I think its really a sick movie i just wasted my time watching this cheap crap I cant believe anyone would produce such a disaster Such a waste of money and time Nothing to learn from this movie its just a hollow sick evil flick I dont think they couldve make it worse this movie just earned its title as the king of lowest crap The acting is a disaster the meaningoh well there is no meaning just a sick pain and sorrow introduced by the suffering child in the end of the movie and the killing of the wife which again was another dumb blow to this movie Do yourself a favor if you actually have some self respect keep away from this awfulness!!!
Couple having financial trouble gets a box delivered to their door If they push the button they get a million dollars but someone they dont know will die Do they push the button? br br This is an odd film based on a Richard Matheson short story has a few chills but mostly is a messy affair The trouble is that there is so much going on it feels as though writer director Richard Kelly didnt know what sort of movie he was making Is this a straight out horror film with supernatural overtones? At times it seems like it with talk of moral choices damnation and the afterlife Is it a science fiction film? Possibly there are lots of questions about that Mars project And what are the strange looks that people seem to have as if in some grand conspiracy? Is this Invasion of the Body Snatchers or a demonic take over film? Dont know maybe And thats the problem there are lots of questions most of them intriguing but there are too many Little seems to have been explained and when we get to the end of the film things seem more to stop then to conclude (even in an open ended way) Im all for making a film rich with themes and points but writer Kelly fills his script with simply too many that director Kelly cant handle or does so in such away that each theme or plot thread gets its ten minutes of screen time and for those minutes it hold court before its cast off the next bit It made me crazy (I wont get into the two leads Cameron Diaz and James Marsden who arent very good or more likely dont know what to make of the material which is so ever shifting ) br br Its a heady mix that doesnt work (there are ultimately too many holes) I got to the end and suddenly realized I had no idea what I just saw I really didnt like it but its more in a this isnt good because it just misses sort of a way rather Id take a pass or wait for cable where its not going to cost you anything
i thought id check this film out as Im currently making a film about a mysterious box therefore it would be great to see how this film took and developed the idea of a mysterious and unexpected boxbr br before going to the cinema i had a high expectation of this film with actresses like Cameron diaz you would expect the acting especially hers to be great the acting was a sort of let down for the film the characters accents changed throughout the film it made it unbelievablebr br the whole idea of a weird box that can make your dreams come true but destroy others is such a brilliant story but i feel the director let it down this film had potential it could of been a lot lot better than it wasbr br this film had no middle to it it was too confusing and needed a steady storyline nobody wants to go into the cinema and come out thinking what have i just watched i didnt get it at all sometimes it can be exciting and make people want to watch it again but this film made people want to never ever want to hear of the film again throughout watching i noticed that half the audience had left before the ending i feel every single person had been let down watching this film because of the high expectations and how slow parts of the film wasbr br lets put the bad points to one side i did like however the scene where the son is in the bathroom at the end it was unexpected it reminded me of a horror movie and the way it was put together made me imagine it and how devastating and scary it would of been to be in that position the lighting and the effects made it look excellent this scene looked slightly more 1990s than the 1970s that this film is supposed to bebr br this film was confusing because it had so many different bits to it parts that you would expect to be sumned up at the end where everything comes clear but it didnt it totally went against an audiences expectations even though leaving the film on a cliff hanger not giving the audience a reason why things happen could work and do really well but this one didnt it was a creative different unusual film i thought it had potential could of been better disappointed didnt enjoy it wouldnt buy it on DVD to be honest
First time I ever felt I needed to write a reviewbr br I have seen thousands of movies in my life and I like a wide range of movies I am reasonably opened minded and can easily say I enjoyed a movie while still saying yeah it was not good but I enjoyed it I can appreciate the mastery of great movies like The Shaw shank redemption the godfather and American history X I can like good movies in a genre like horror or comedy even if the movie might not be that great I can even enjoy a bad movie that just happens to entertain me (Bloodsport) I also will try to rate movie fairly even if I did not like it City lights by Charlie Chapin was not a movie I enjoyed but I can appreciate the acting and story lines for the timebr br I think some people when they go on this site instead of randomly click a rating should take a few ideas into account Try to rate the movie based on how good it actually was Do not let your personal bias affect the rating Also look at other moves you rated and compare the movie you are going to ratebr br This movie was the worst piece of trash I have ever seen 2 hours of my life where just stolen The acting was awful across the board The scenes where choppy at best However the real disgrace was the story The first 20 minutes we actually had a story that tried to make sense and take the viewer from point A to B However after that it was a nightmare They kept trying to add new elements but nothing was every explained Nothing really ever made sense was steward dead is he alive did he hit by lighting was it really lighting was it aliens is he an alien etc The ending tied nothing together and really did not answer any questions The only positive was nobody cared we where just happy to leave the theaterbr br 6510??? What is wrong with some of you? I will admit that the 8 of us where so mad about seeing this we did think what would make it better? and we decide to tell a few of our friends that this movie was good so they would have to suffer and see this movie What can I say misery loves company That is really the only reason I can see for a 65 ratingbr br Do not waste your life!
THE BOX (2009)  Cameron Diaz James Marsden Frank Langella James Rebhorn Holmes Osborne Sam Oz Stone Celia Weston Truly disappointing adaptation of genre legend Richard Mathesons sci-fi chiller Button Button by on the wane wunderkind filmmaker Richard Kelly who truly stretches a small well-crafted piece into a grab-bag WTF-a-thon! Mysterious (and ridiculously maimed!) man Langella posits a million dollar offer to struggling couple Diaz and Marsden (both surprisingly vanilla bland to the hilt!): a box with a red-button that when pushed will kill some stranger in the world (!) Sure strings are attached but does that really matter here? What does is why in the name of God does Kelly trowel on so much oddness (ie nose-bleeds; watery transport systems  thats right  WateryTransportSystems) when the tension should be strung as tautly as possible (oh the possibilities) If this sounds like a bad TWILIGHT ZONE episode you are half right (the 80s TV re-boot actually did a decent small-screen adaptation; in fact rent that instead!) One of the years worst films
Before you dismiss my post as not getting it let me sayIm one of the biggest Richard Kelly and The Twilight Zone fans out there Donnie Darko is one my all-time favorites and I even thought Southland Tales had its moments Im a HUGE sci-fi fan I was very excited to see The Box couldnt wait for it to come outbr br Having said thatThe Box is terrible Behind Drag Me To Hell this was the worst movie Ive seen in 2009 And it just simply WILL NOT end! Whenever you think youve reached the end another change in the plot and youre off to more torture I was actually groaning in the theater by the end of the filmI could hardly take it anymorebr br The biggest problem with The Box no matter how you slice it or try to justify it is that it simply makes little sense Trust me I got it I understood what was going on But that doesnt mean it makes a lot of sense looking back on it Take the basics for example The main coupleCameron Diaz and James Marsden playing Norma and Arthur Lewis Diaz loses her finances at her job then bemoans to her husband that they are living paycheck to paycheck Well sell that f-ing Porsche your husband is driving then!!! They live in a beautiful 2-story house in a nice subdivision Marsden is working what seems to be a high-paid job at NASA and Diaz is an accomplished teacher And yes Marsden drives an overly expensive car But they are somehow living paycheck to paycheck?!? No need to press the button just cut down your high-priced lifestyle a bit! The movie would have worked better if they showed the couple jobless and in serious debt Instead they are seemingly desperate for moneyall the while living what I would call a luxurious lifestyle Like I saidyou can understand whats going on yet it still makes little sense! Thats a rare combinationbr br There was an awful scene in a library that I feel will go down as one of the worst segments in movie history (terribly acted too by the way) It was idiotic illogical and out of place I cant even begin to fully describe it actually so I will move onto a subplot that involves nose-bleeds and body possession by aliens (Yes Im being serious unfortunately) A kid is in Diazs class with a wicked and smile on his face (a sinister smile that seemingly goes by completely unnoticed by everyone in authority at the school) He starts asking Diaz personal questions literally embarrassing her in front of her class No punishment is given to the kid whatsoeverhe didnt even get asked to stay after class for a talk! Then Diaz is at a partyand the same kid is one of the hired helpironed shirt apron and all! I dont know many alien-possessed kids (who appear to be in Junior High) that also moonlight as a bus-boy at parties sponsored by teachers and school officialsbut we found one here! (See what I meanyou can understand it completely but it still makes no sensea rare combo!) Like many things in the movie the kid comes and goesno real explanation about him no ending to his character Moving on A lady then approaches Diaz in a grocery store telling her that experiments are being ran secretly and her family is one of the test subjects Wellhmmmif aliens possess the powers where they can take over a body remotelyand the aliens dont want to help Diazthen who was taking over this ladys body and giving Diaz advice?! AgainThe lady was trying to help Diazand the aliens werent interested in helping Diazso who the hell was controlling her body?! Never explained Never talked about again No nothing!! It goes on and on and on like this for what seemed to me like 2 weeks It would not end! I wonder if this movie underwent a massive re-shoot at some point It was poorly edited Diazs accent was there one minute gone the next Sub-plots began but never ended The numerous push-backs of the release date obviously shows the problems the producers had with the finished product Its truly a train-wreckbr br Pass on this onetheres no redeeming value in it whatsoever 3 out of 10 just because I like Diaz and sci-fi!

Ha ha - oh no - what to say about this film? Yes - green eggs and ham makes more sense than this movie Where does one start? A lot of the good stuff has already been said - so I wont divulge into the same territory I believe you already have the movie summary - so I wont paraphrase the moviebr br First - lets start the with goodbr br 1) If you like psychological thrillers that make you think (as I do) the first 29 minutes of this film will be for you - this is one of those films that illustrates the question that you always talked about on long car drives when you were kids like (what if you had to chose one family member live another to die or what if you had to die by drowning or fire) This movie is a great concept - bottom linebr br 2) The wardrobe group did a fine job with bringing us back to the 70s Realistically though how difficult is that to accomplish? Okay thats about all for the good Lets talk about the badbr br 1) This movie feels like a 2 hour Twilight Zone episode This could easily be 90 minutes That might have made the movie tolerablebr br 2) Do you remember in the movie From Dusk til Dawn? The movie started out interesting then halfway through the movie it just took a degrading turn? Yep - same thing here I would venture to say that the writers started with a concept then had no idea what to do with it Ive gotten deeper thought provocation out of Transformers 2br br 3) Yes - we get the dilemma in the film We understand the philosophical undertones and Utilitarian approach - but the story jumped around way too much didnt elaborate on the current story arc and took a(forgive me)completely insulting directionbr br 4) The ending didnt make sense Not at all Nonebr br This movie would make a great term paper in college philosophy 101 If youre board out of your mind in bed sick or have ever enjoyed being hit in the face with a pie and can view this free on-line - by all means go for itbr br If you need to pay anything to view this movie dont waste your time - youre better off watching old Howie Mandel stand-up on You Tube You will get more philosophical stimulation reorganizing your sock drawer
Be warned the next time you see Richard Kelly involved in any production run away Fastbr br Kelly proved to the world after his last movie Southland Tales that he is one pretentious director It was indulgent and convoluted In The Box not much has changedbr br I can picture what his pitch to Warner Bros must have been and I bet the executives at the studio ate it right up: a full-feature film based on one of Richard Twilight Zone Mathesons old short storiesbr br Big mistake! Do not read any further unless you want this movie COMPLETELY spoiled for you: br br Norma (Cameron Diaz) pushes the button br br Turns out that Arlington Steward (Frank Langella) has an Alien using his body as a vessel to conduct experiments in which the fate of mankind rests His face is scarred because he was struck by Alien lightening which killed him but then brought him back to life to do all of this red button testing Obviously since Norma pushes the button knowing full well that someone may die she must suffer the consequences for failing to consider someone elses life instead of her own In the end she and her husband (James Marsden) choose to kill Norma instead of having their son grow up deaf and blindbr br Kelly dances around his films message trying to make the audience figure out what the moral of the story is Obviously any person with a brain is saying at the beginning What if I was the person who dies? Richard Kelly doesnt even let his characters have this normal HUMAN conversation In fact they avoid it all together They appear to both be educated working at a prestigious school and also for NASA so why wouldnt they both have a better ability to LOOK OUTSIDE OF THE BOX???br br If he had the main characters actually have this conversation the entire movie could have ended right there! Instead we have to watch weddings go on forever NASA and the NSA be complacent to Arlington Stewart taking over these government programs teleportation to show Marsden life beyond our world so it will be easier to kill his wife and drones controlled by Steward which can be anywhere and nowhere at any timebr br The most painful part of this movie is the pacing Nothing really happens Its a muddled mish-mash of ideas that are laughablebr br It is insufferable how this film is being marketed The commercials make it look like Saw and even use the music from those films to sell it In reality what you get is a slow dull laughable (yes half the theater was laughing at the acting and visual effects) and messy film which is neither imaginative interesting nor cohesive At one point Cameron Diaz and her son are abducted and then suddenly she is back in the NSAs big black car with her husband on the way home Where did she go? Why did they take her? Do we really care? Not anymore you wontbr br By the end you really wont care what happens to any of the characters You will be rooting for all of them to die so the film will just end Go see anything else thats playing Dont waste your time or money
I know that so many reviews on IMDb are extreme with reviewers either praising a film to the hilt or inarticulately tearing it to pieces I find neither of these kind of reviews helpful and so I do not give this film the awful review I am about to lightly The film is art-house science-fiction of the worst kind dressed up as a Hollywood blockbuster The trailers draw you in by showing you what appears to be a cohesive plot but is actually just a tiny part of a wilfully baffling series of events which are never properly resolved I like films which challenge the viewer and I do not need to be spoon-fed a plot and so my complaint against this film is not that it is too highbrow No - the film is just terrible As the credits roll you will feel genuine anger at having wasted your time on Cameron Diazs wooden acting and a faltering plot-line Avoid
In 1976 a mother named Norma Lewis (Cameron Diaz) lives with her son Walter and her husband Arthur (James Marsden) One night a box is placed on the doorstep of their home and the following morning they cut open the box to reveal a button device that must be opened with a key By the late afternoon a man with terrible scarring on his face comes to their door and presents Norma with an offer This man is Arlington Steward (Frank Langella) and he announces that if they push the button someone in the world that the family does not know will die and they will receive a million dollars in cash If they dont press it nothing will happen and the offer will move on to someone else Norma and Arthur are not allowed to tell anyone including their son about this deal The incentive for the family to push the button is heightened by their financial difficulties Arthur who is currently working for NASA fails to be accepted into a new job he applies for and Norma who is a teacher learns that her faculty funding is being cutbr br Ones enjoyment for this bizarre sci-fi thriller based on the short story Button Button by Richard Matheson will be determined by how far they are willing to take this ludicrous premise The opening of the film is particularly problematic in grounding itself in a sense of realism with the household Richard Kellys previous film Donnie Darko cleverly used the condition of schizophrenia to justify its excursion into paranormal activity and parallel universes Without the dream-like state of that far superior film The Box and the very thought of a device that can kill anyone in the world is entirely implausible That Norma would also accept someone into her house that has almost the same scarring as Two-Face from The Dark Knight and believe this offer seems equally contrivedbr br If this sounds unlikely so far what follows is even more absurd involving a conspiracy about someone who was struck by lightning the possibility of alien life or some other Godly being influencing these situations Scenes involving gateways opening up in public libraries random nose bleeds and mindless drones stalking the Lewis family become almost unintentionally comical in their absurdity To a point the film could be called intriguing purely to see where it is going Kelly is occasionally clever in his ability to hold our attention through many of the films contrivances In one scene Norma is teaching a class and then is asked by a strange boy about her foot He taunts her about it as she is missing four of her toes Later at a rehearsal dinner for a wedding that Norma and Arthur are attending this same student appears as a waiter and seems to be stalking them Yet the eventual justification for these all of these oddities is wrapped up in a highly contrived sci-fi revelation that many will find implausible and difficult to swallowbr br What is most disappointing about the film is that once the button is pressed surprisingly early on many of the moral implications that were initially promised are diminished for much of pictures duration The ending which wont be spoilt here resurfaces these moral questions again in the hope of echoing that of a Greek tragedy While the resemblances can be seen by this point given the unlikelihood of so much of the film and the uneven performances there is little reason to care Cameron Diazs Southern accent might be unnecessary but it is surprisingly Langella who is the most disappointing in the film with a very unsubtly written role as the mysterious scarred man who seems to be hiding a military base that would make Dr Evil proud It really is just a shadow of his towering performance in FrostNixon There is not a lot for many of the other actors in the film to do; in particular both Norma and Arthur could not be regarded as characters but mouthpieces for Kellys pastiche of ideas Underdeveloped and brief conversations such as where Norma sympathises with Arlington over their deformities and also when Norma and Arthur question whether they really know each other in case the button kills either of them highlights thisbr br Since 2001 Richard Kelly has failed to make a film that has lived up to the quality and the imagination of Donnie Darko Though this film might be intriguing for a little while it is too absurd and implausible to be fully enjoyed and it would certainly not warrant multiple viewings given the films rather illogical revelations Science fiction fans might be able to appreciate it somewhat more and draw their own conclusions but what Kelly is really trying to say beneath the surface remains cryptic The Box is one film this year that should have been shelved
A box with a button provides a couple with the opportunity to be financially free but the cost is the life of someone theyve never met This is a very tedious film to watch Richard Kelly who wrote and directed it decided to make a film without any payoff You are taken on a ride of slow build ups one after the other with minor revelations at best At certain moments I thought to myself this will have major significance at the end but nothing does The film just leaves one thinking This story could have been told in 30 minutes without all the stretched out nonsense I will hope you avoid this god-awful film and maintain your sanity by doing so
Set in 1976 for no apparent reason other than to keep the set dressers busy The Box was directed by Richard Kelly (Donnie Darko) and stars Cameron Diaz and James Marsden as Norma and Arthur Lewis a young couple who are supposedly struggling financially even though they both have successful careers--she as a high school teacher he as an optical specialist at NASAs Langley Virginia Research Center They have one child Walter (Sam Oz Stone)br br One day the Lewises find a parcel on their doorstep containing a black box with a big red button There is a note from a Mr Steward indicating that he will return at 5:00 PM to explain about the boxbr br The mysterious Arlington Steward played by Frank Langella shows up at the appointed time nattily attired in an elegant Savile Row suit He is polite but businesslike however his most noticeable feature is his face half of which appears to have been blown off and improperly attended to Langella is the only thing worth watching in the movie however he is unfortunately upstaged by his own makeup which resembles that of Harvey Two Face Dent (Aaron Eckhart) from Christopher Nolans The Dark Knight Its like the elephant in the room: one can try to ignore it but its more than a little distractingbr br Steward explains that he will return in 24 hours to collect the button If during that time they decide to unlock and push the button he will give them $1 million cash The only catch--and its a big one--is that somewhere a stranger will die It might be across town it might be on another continent however Steward assures them the victim will be someone unknown to them As a show of good faith he leaves them with a crisp $100 bill theirs to keep whether they push the button or notbr br Arthur and Norma are skeptical believing the whole thing to be a scam or an elaborate hoax however it isnt long before they begin to wonder what would happen if they did push the button? Would they really get a million dollars? Would somebody really die? Weary of the speculation Norma slaps the button Nothing happens However their initial relief gives way to alarm when Steward shows up the next day with a briefcase full of cash They decide to call the whole thing off however Steward tells them its too late Youve already pushed the button he explains As Stewards limo pulls away Arthur notes the license number which he later discovers is registered to the NSA (National Security Agency)br br At this point the film begins to veer deeply into unfollowable territory as the secondary characters start springing nosebleeds and flashing peace signs Meanwhile the town becomes invaded by pudgy slack-jawed geeks in bad shirts who start following Arthur around like an advance scouting party for a race of zombie alien nerds Arthur eventually becomes trapped by the menacing bookworms in the library (?) where Stewards spinsterish wife shows up--whom we havent seen till now--and informs Arthur that in order to get out of the library he must step into one of three vertical columns of cheesy-looking digital water effects What happens if I choose the wrong one? Arthur asks seeming far less baffled than he ought to be under the circumstances and certainly far less baffled than the audience is by this time Eternal damnation the spinster says ominouslybr br Arthur steps into the middle column of digital liquid effects and after a brief absence suddenly appears still in his water cocoon hovering over Normas bed When she wakes up and sees him the water bubble bursts and Arthur tumbles onto the bed in a shower of water which oddly enough continues to drip from the overhead water pipes just out of camera range while a sodden Marsden and Diaz flop around on the bedbr br Its confusing I knowbr br We eventually learn that Steward was once the public relations officer for the NSA until he was struck by a lightning bolt that destroyed part of his face He was pronounced dead but later came back to life having been transformed into a sort of superman who now serves the ones who make the lightning and whose powers have enabled him to take over the CIA the NSA and NASA all by himselfbr br And what is the point of all this nattering rubbish? Apparently Stewards mission is to subject humans to a kind of biblical character test (eg the Binding of Isaac) to determine whether humanity is worth saving If enough people pass the button test by refusing to push it Stewards god-like overlords will spare the race Unfortunately those people who do push the button such as Norma and Arthur must be punished for their moral spinelessness to which end they are subjected to a series of dreary Lady or the Tiger ordeals that play out like one of those Saw movies except without the entertaining gore or the benefit of a coherent plotbr br The Box represents the sort of pointless mental masturbation that freshman philosophy students like to blather on about after a few beers Richard Kellys tedious exercise in existentialist pettifoggery eventually collapses under the weight of its own incomprehensibility; the tortured melange of insupportable ideas eventually congeals as with the mixing together of too many colors into a meandering gray goo of a film as insipid as one of those narcotizing in-flight movies the plot of which suffers no more or less from having been interrupted by a leisurely napbr br There is a point in The Box where Arthur who is a technically-minded guy becomes curious about how the button works Opening up the unit he is disappointed to find nothing insidebr br Having seen The Box I know exactly how he feels
This must be the first movie Ive rented and not seen to the end Complete garbage! The acting the plot set and wardrobe looked like it came from a porno movie with a plot Not even a B move
Without being really the worst science fiction film ever made or the worst I have seen Time Under Fire is still much under average The premises and the first 10-15 minutes are not that bad it starts as a X-Files story combining Bermuda triangle mysteries with time travel Pretty soon elements of other genres (too many) mix together but the story never takes off beyond the level of interest of a TV series Soon Time Under Fire quickly degenerates into a series of clichés not only mixing altogether too many genres but also being unable to create anything memorable in suspense or special effects that would help viewers remember the movie until tomorrow Acting is bad and the rhetoric lines in the script do not help at all
Where do I begin? The story was so bad it must have been written in a high school film club! The acting was so wooden I felt sorry for the actors! One actor even reminded me of what a deer must look like when staring into a cars headlights! Another actor has this constant look of being constipated! But it was the dialog that takes the cake! br br Our hero says to his captors - all holding submachine guns - if you lay a finger on a female prisoner you will be dead Moments later the strongest guard built like a truck and the only women prisoner go at it When our fearless leader who has this very annoying raspy gangster voice catches wind of this transgression he calmly walks up to the guard while machine guns are trained on him and in a split-second snaps this giant guys neck like he was breaking a tooth pick! He then gets back in line while all the villains with their machine guns do absolutely nothing but essentially yell at him!br br I could go on and on! This movie is camp gem; and if you have any sense of humor its guaranteed to make you laugh so hard your eyes will tear!
Drab dreary and a total waste of my time The plot is incomprehensible (so dont think about it too much) The acting is odd and wooden - I would have sworn that they were all professional body builders trying their luck at acting but that might be an insult to body builders There are no interesting special effects to redeem this disaster but lots of fires explosions a gratuitous sex scene etc The only thing that caught my attention was that it takes place after a war between the US and Iraq that somehow goes nuclearhmmm Is Roger Corman psychic? Lets hope that Iraq was just a lucky choice for Corman and that the rest of his scenario doesnt come true br br 
whos responsible for these behind the scenes things? who are these actors? did they crawl out from beneath rocks? yuks lots of yuks! no no yuks for me only loathing and shame that i am a human being i have to avert my eyes from the set its so embarrassing in fact i changed the channelbr br ive always had a problem with robin williams non-stop i forgot my lithium today rantings but at least hes funny once in a blue moon watching someone who isnt funny at all impersonating robin williams is like having each tooth in your head pulled slowly and sadistically without novocaine for all eternitybr br please stop making these absolutely horrifying TV movies please
Arthur Hunnicutt plays a very stereotypical role as a mountain man (probably the Ozarks) who goes hunting with his favorite coon dog However the dog appears to be drowning when Hunnicutt jumps in after him It becomes obvious pretty soon that despite Hunnicutt and his dog roaming about after leaving the water that they both died in the water--as no one responds when he talks to them and sees and hears people talking about his and the dogs death Yet oddly Hunnicutt is REALLY slow on the uptake and it takes him a while to understand they are talking about him! I think this was actually done as padding as there really wasnt enough material to fill the half hour time slotbr br Later in the surprise twist he comes upon Heaven--or at least his concept of the place Hes invited in but since they wont allow dogs he has other ideas! Overall reasonably well acted but of dubious spiritual value! With no twists or irony this episode is a bit dull--not Twilight Zone-y enough for my tastes
As a South African living in South Africa again after a 32 year stay in the UK I am sorry to say that this movie is a huge disappointment The three main problems I had with the movie was a) why Swank and Ejiofor - an American and a Nigerian - to play the leads This country is bursting with talent and has no need of imports b) Gillian Slovo has been trading off her Struggle credentials for years now Shes a very mediocre writer and even her novel doesnt stand up the flaccid direction of Mr Hooper and c) Hilary Swank again such a great actor as proved in Million Dollar Baby (but thats Eastwood too) here dressed in the contemporary New York style whilst roaming freely around the poverty of the Karoo Where was the consideration and sensitivity needed by the costumer and director? Yes the film is ultimately moving - how could it not be? - but the overall mood at the conclusion is one of tremendous letdown Hearts in the right place but needs a pace maker
Dont see this movie! Its repulsive! The start is indeed very good but in the middle everything falls and I really regret spending 80 crowns (about 11 dollars) on the ticket! Peter Dalle should consider this as his last chance to gain peoples interest AWFUL picture! The only bright spot is the splendid work of Robert Gustavsson Lena Nyman and Gösta Ekmanbr br Hope you take my advise The picture is rubbish
If I could give this movie a negative rating I would The humor is the cruelest I have ever seen in a film Horrible things happen to good people and people who have already suffered horribly through no fault of their own There are 2 plots neither of which supports half of a film Where is the depth others see in this movie? That no good deed goes unpunished? That only the heartless can succeed? The film does start well and the black and white is very moody and well done The acting is very good and convincing witch makes the cruel humor even more horrifying If you think that the 3 Stooges are too nice to each other if watching the beheading of a kidnap victim with a Bowie knife is a real thigh slapper if you thought Schindlers List was hilarious then this movie is for you
Set in 1945 Skenbart follows a failed Swedish book editor who decides to take a non-stop train to Berlin Unfortunately for everyone around him hes a walking disaster causing mayhem everywhere he goes The train also holds a man and his mistress scheming to murder the mans wife (whos also on the train) a soldier on his way home two gay elderly gentlemen an angry train conductor two nuns a bunch of refugees and even more peoplebr br Meant as a mix of noir-ish thriller (which it does quite well - at least to begin with) and comedy the film fails with both It doesnt sit right as the film changes tone with every new scene And as the train races towards its final destination the film turns more and more bizarre ending on a truly surreal notebr br The good bits are wasted in a myriad of pointless plots and characters Skenbart is packed with famous Swedish actors no matter how small the part is It feels like the filmmakers rang everyone theyve ever worked with and offered them a part in the film Too bad that the performances are just as bad as the script (act your lines - dont read them!)br br The comedy is more or less slapstick with the same jokes repeated over and over The pace is incredibly slow at times (quite often actually) with on scene in particular dragging on for about ten minutes for no good reason The screenwriter also seems to think that swearing is a good way to replace decent dialogue The film looks great though in moody B&W but its wasted on such inept film-making in every other department [110]
Outside Sweden you are not expected have seen this movie Happy you The cast includes several actors that are important part of modern the Swedish movie history And still br br Seems like Peter Dalle only had a an idea lasting for about 20 minutes Robert Gustafson is totally misused in this movie trying to copy a younger Gösta Ekman Ekman by the way is the only actor fulfilling the expectations br br Credit that can be given is for the photo splendid idea using black and white Music is OKbr br But over-all its a waste of god actors and the time of the audience
I had this movie given to me and have to admit I am glad that I did not pay money for itbr br The back of the box makes it seem like some kind of sex triangle with 2 women trying to seduce her But the reality in this movie is far from thatbr br In reality the main subject is the victim of a vicious and sadistic rape by the two other characters There was absolutely nothing in this that I found interesting at allbr br Even movies like Silence Of The Lambs and Wild Things (which the box tries to compare this movie to) were riveting because of the unexpected turns and suspensebr br But Jaded has none of this It concentrates on the rapeists and the sick relationship with the boyfriend of one of them And the persuit of a videotape that may prove the victims story is truebr br While it does show that same sex rape is possible it is not a movie worth watchingbr br If at all possible pass this movie up at all costs
Jaded offers a premise with potential as it looks at the rape of a woman by two other women and ask the question when is rape not rape? Unfortunately the flick seems to suffer from bad direction as it slogs through legal minutia while trying to weave some kind of story with a handful of foul mouthed and poorly portrayed characters only to end abruptly Jaded is lame stuff only for the bleary-eyed couch potato in the mood for some dark drama
Hard to imagine what they were thinking of when they made this movie (ie the writers directors producers actors editors etc) Christopher Plummer veteran of 129 movies frolics along among scores of other actors with apparently no more motivation than to collect a paycheck I guess there is nothing wrong with that but once they are paid that doesnt mean anyone has to watch itbr br It bugs me that there are actually good reviews for this movie here at imdb Art? If you want to see art go to an art gallery dont watch this movie Comedy? Watch a re-run of the Flintstones about the same plot with less time wastedbr br Dabney Coleman gives his usual performance for better or worse And some of the young actors may have gotten some good experience from doing this movie But Plummer???? It was embarrassing to watch his performance in fact I was positively transfixed on him throughout the movie knowing this was Plummer of Sound of Music fame! I see from his bio that he called Sound of Music sound of mucus so guess he didnt like it as much as the 100s of millions who liked him in itbr br I wonder if today he was asked how do you rate Sound of Music compared to Where the Heart Is what would he say?br br Probably something like Where the Money Is
Im a Boorman fan but this is arguably his least successful film Comedy has never been his strong suit and here his attempts at screwball farce are clumsily done Still its almost worth seeing for Boormans eye for talent: this is one of Uma Thurmans first starring roles and as always she is ravishing to watch (On a sad side note Boorman wrote the script with his daughter Telsche who died a couple years ago)
I say this If you want to see art you go to an art gallery If you want to see a movie you go to a theater Trying to intertwine art and film proves disastrous in Where the Heart Is An interesting cast is totally wasted in this embarrassment You like Dabney Coleman see Short Time You like Crispin Glover see Bartleby You like Uma Thurman see Kill Bill Above all if you like Christopher Plummer see The Silent Partner because his character here is a terrible embarrassment In fact this entire production is an embarrassment Sure the human artwork is intriguing for a few minutes so make a short but do not subject an audience to pointless nonsense masquerading as filmed entertainment - MERK
After seeing this piece of crap you will know why the limeys drive on the left side of the streetthis movie is an absolute NO-BRAINER! The jokes (if this is the right word for it) are mostly sub-standard (about 98%) and do miss any punch-line at all Save the money and get drunk You might enjoy this movie being totally wasted perhaps!
it really is terrible from start to finish youll sit and watch this ridiculous idiot thinking hes cool when hes really not rubbish plot line terrible acting and complete waste of time and money do NOT bother
I like Ali Gs show I believe the guy has comedic instinct but hasnt (yet) developed it to a talentbr br The movie is a little worse than I was expecting I dont find Ali-G offensive just stupid Jokes for 5-year olds some good some terriblebr br If you want to watch a movie that seems offensive but is actually funny see Tom Greens Freddy Got Fingeredbr br 210
I had already heard of Ali G in Madonnas music video Music I always think hes funny (In fact he really is) Just last year I always thought of buying a VCD of Ali G Indahouse Thats why some months later I bought it cheap and I started watching itbr br But the movie surprised me My older brother and I were expecting it to be a great laugh-out comedy It turns out that Indahouse is just a stupid piece of garbage It was really really bad It also contains explicit sexuality content and very crude humor It also didnt made me laugh even just a big smile We definitely hate that movie Oh by the way I have plans to sell itbr br Ali G was really different in his movie compared to his TV shows-- in such a negative way Maybe he wasnt really well-focused and enough serious to make this flick Just because theres some sex scenes in it doesnt mean its freaking hilarious (because sometimes too much isnt that laughable anymore) For the first time ever I was disappointed at him That really made me sad rather and happybr br I gave this movie 1 over 10 Actually I really want to give it a 0 rating Its one of the worst movies Ive seen in my entire life I wouldnt recommend to anyone who wanna watch good comedies that arent too explicit or horrible
Dont tell me this film was funny or a little funny It was a complete disaster and one of the worst movies Ive ever seen Ali G is only funny on Channel 4s Ali G Show After watching his performance all i can say is He is not made for Movies With a Daft script or more like no storyline theres nothing to keep you entertained Full of annoying unrealistic characters this movie is a complete garbage all the way At the end of the film Ali G gives a speech He mentions if you hated this film tell people it was good Not even the speech could save the movie He probably knew its gonna be a stinker I would of given this a 010 but the minimum start is 1 Overall Dont even waste your time on this rubbish
Bean Kevin & Perry UK TV creations that have made successful transitions onto the BIG screen Now its Ali Gs turn and I m afraid to say this is not one of them!br br Ali has always been obscene but funny with it This film was extremley sick and not funny at all Scenes involving bestiality gay sex and paedophilia should not be portrayed for entertainments sakebr br Ali G In Da House is rubbish and deserves making very little moneybr br 1 out 10
If I compare two films with Sacha Cohen Borat and Ali G then Ali G is immeasurably better Its no master piece but its a film at least Borat is complete garbage and I do not understand how it rated better then Ali Gbr br I cannot put my finger on it there something wrong with the Ali G script: half of the jokes are as if written by a 15 years old not by an adult scriptwriter And a number of jokes including Mr Cohens lower body are quite tasteless br br But the film actually comes together as a comedy and there are some valid jokes too that are funny: such as how Ali G becomes a member of government for doing something scandalous and stupid in the public (sadly true in todays western society: people get careers for doing stupid things in public) also Alis advice about immigrant policy and some others br br Ali G overall remains a sympathetic character even though a kind of mentally underdeveloped for his age But its OK to watchits quite funnybr br But never ever watch Borat its awful and makes every intelligent movielover sick
My god how bad this is Who is this impostor pretending to be Ali G? Avoid this at all costs It replaces the smart multi-layered satire and humour of his show with down and out toilet humourbr br This was obviously an attempt to get him known in the States before he released his show there on HBObr br One commentator here pleads that we not judge the movie on the merits of the show due to the difference in the mediums While it is true that the standard format of the show could never have been transferred to the big screen Mr Sacha Baron Cohen could have ensured the smart use of his comic style in a more conventional movie storyline Instead we have this mess which in all honesty has nothing at all to do with Ali G except for the packagingbr br Terribly disappointing Go seek out the DVDs of Innit Aiiii or Bling Bling for some real Ali G
Ali G was funny at first His interviews were fresh and original The idea of a mock gangster wearing OTT clothes and using street wise lingo was appealing at firstbr br But this film is just a rehash of old jokes the humour was mainly childish and revolved around the male sex organ for the most part The film claimed good actors like Charles Dance but their talents were wasted as they played silly 2-d characters It is not terrible but isnt really funny at all a second time It could be said that the movie was Ali Gs last bastion of comedy After that he ran out of steam
I have absolutely no idea why I watched Ali G Indahouse except for the fact that Salon seemed to think a crime was committed by not nominating Sacha Baron Cohen for a Emmy for his work on Da Ali G Show It is a sure bet that I will never watch that show as there was absolutely nothing funny about the movie Comedy? Torture was more like it It was just about the stupidest thing I every watched I will admit that I was captivated by Rhona Mitra I had not seen her in anything She wasnt on The Practice during the time I was watching so I guess I will have to check out Boston Legal one of these evenings to see how she does in something that may be worth watching
MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS For about the last four years Ive been a keen fan of Ali G Sacha Baron Cohen is undoubtedly a very funny and intelligent guy and in my view his best creation is Borat whos as funny as Hell and quite shameless in what he does and says to peoplebr br Anyway to the movie I didnt bother paying money to see this in the cinema; I suppose because I didnt expect a lot but when I hired the DVD recently I found the whole thing pretty sad The best part of Alis taking the mickey out of others was largely missing and the script an plot was pretty damned awful; hooking all the car batteries together to blow a safe - REALLY!!?? br br This movie goes to show I think that some things can run for too long and definitely dont translate to the big screen The movie also had that syrupy sweet ending that Ive come to expect from British films Where have all the good British movie making ideals gone to? That said there were the odd very funny moments such as the dog in Alis bed and Alis audience with HM the Q with the Shaven haven - RESPECT remarkbr br So in summary I am an Ali G and Borat fan and I have enjoyed many of his interviews (notably the one with Anita Roddick of the Body Shop) but this movie fell really flat with me If theres to be another movie I hope its a whole lot better than this lot of old tripebr br Weasel100 br br Canberra Australia
When I went to see this film lets not say that I had high expectations But merely that I had a faint hope that this full length feature would have at least some of the hilarity and wit of TVs Da Ali G Showbr br But as one might expect this cannot translate from a half hour TV show to a 90 minute film The movie had no appeal what so ever and resorted entirely to toilet and juvenile sexual humour Basicaly I should have ditched it halfway through but was silly enough to think it might somehow improve by the end how wrong I was I loved the show but hated the movie This movie is only for those who find fellatio by canines amusing
Even before this film it is clear to see that Ali G has become the exact character he set out to parody I am not a fan of Sacha Baron Cohens character anyway but was curious to see how a man of so little talent was able to convince universal studios to fund a near 1 and a half hour feature film out of a 3 minute joke br br A paper-thin plot is just a torrent of penis and marijuana jokes and I must admit I did cringe when I saw such respected thespians as Charles Dance and Michael Gambon stoop so low for employment Saying that I must admit (even if I am quite ashamed to) that I did raise a titter on more than one occasion and however bad this film was it was never boring and never once did I consider switching it off (mainly due to the gorgeous Rhona Mitra) Saying that only watch this film if you are a teenage lad aged between 14 to 17 and you find dick jokes hilarious
First off let me say I wasted Halloween movie night by watching this garbage Second let me inform you that the current DVD available by Shriek Show is not uncut so you gore hounds will be very upset Third that one scene is the highlight of the film and since its been cut well you see where Im goingbr br I know a lot of horror fans dig this movie It is atmospheric shot in the woods with some very nice scenery waterfalls and such But after the opening kill which has a very brutal shot of a machete being jammed through a hunters crotch you get no real brutal kills after that And with a slasher movie you sort of want that At least I do The director and co do nothing new with the killer in the woods idea several of this type of movie were all made right around the same time in the very early eighties The only thing this has going for it is that you dont hate the actors as much as you might in other films They are sort of likable The kids have a reason for being there: one of them owns a deed to some property on the mountain But what is not explained is why his family has property there There is no cabin or house so why buy property in East Jesus especially if you arent a hunter or whatnot? Well Im sure some people do buy land for camping purposes but that just seems unusual Anyway two squealing backwoods inbreds show up and start stalking the campers and picking them off one by one And as I said before you get pretty much nothing in the way of decent deaths after the machete kill in the beginning The ending has a sort of off the wall kill by Connie but even that isnt enough to save this from being almost equal with the completely forgettable film The Forest which is mind-numbingbr br If Shriek Show had been able to get a real uncut print then this review might have been a little more forgiving but this is the day and age of uncutunrated DVD releases of old obscure films for cine-hounds like me When you slight us you get the crud review Sadly the presence of the great fatherly George Kennedy is the only highlight of this movie to set it apart from the other garden variety trash that was churned out back in the day
OK yes I know Im a Philistine and I have no knowledge of nor love for opera I readily admit that I might feel differently about this film if I did But I dont So for those of you like me skip this one unless you want to look at the pretty (sometimes unclothed) girls For what its worth I thought the first segment with Theresa Russell (who I didnt recognize) was the best of the lot
This is a classic example of what happens when a sit com is on TV for far far too long Everything gets tired and the jokes start getting repeated over and over again OK from the start the first couple of series were quite good You had an Entertainment Manager (Simon Cadel) being pursued by his deputy played by Ruth Madoc a cleaning lady wanting to become a yellow coat an alcoholic child-hating Punch and Judy man a bent Jockey and a stand up comedian As said earlier it started well but went on way too long Once Simon Cadel left it went downhill fast you were getting dire story lines and a new entertainments manager who Ruth Madoc (again) threw herself at When a comedy is all filmed in one place there is a limit to the number of jokes that can be cracked Unfortunately this went on so long every joke was cracked 3 or 4 times over If this comedy had been stopped after 2 series it would have gone down as an all time classic As it is it will be largely remembered for the dreadful last few series
Unlike the other spaghetti Westerns this one has characters that almost make sense and can be identified to some degree It still has the goofy gunplay of other spaghettis Westerns A spaghetti by the way is another word for a Western with no plot no characters you can care about and goofy gunplay that doesnt make a bit of sense for the era and relying on great music to make audiences feel something This one is more lighthearted like the ones that Bud Spencer and Terence Hill made together They too were superior to the junk made by Eastwood and others which sado-masochists make their friends watch if they get a chance It looks like everyone had a lot of fun making the movie too It was good to see a giant actor like Gilbert Roland who wasnt even mentioned on the movie rental box yet who was clearly the biggest name His character was very enjoyable There is a three way standoff at the end which is much superior to the one it spoofs (The Good the Bad and the Ugly) simply because the characters are at least a bit likable and a bit identifiable Not a good movie but has a bit of fun to it
ANY GUN CAN PLAY (2 outta 5 stars) Totally routine spaghetti western starring that guy who used to play Kookie on 77 Sunset Strip The plot is some convoluted nonsense about some stolen gold coins and various gunmen of dubious motivation trying to track it down This is one of those lighthearted westerns which means lots of labored attempts at comedy and some really atrocious music during most of the action sequences (you can tell this isnt Ennio Morricones work) George Hilton plays a bounty hunter called Stranger but he doesnt leave much of an impression he just doesnt have the style of Clint Eastwood or Franco Nero who are able to do a lot with a sparsely-written character The ending is a complete homageparody of the ending of The Good The Bad and the Ugly though its barely amusing enough to be considered a parody The highlight of the movie is the first 5 minutes which features actors patterned after Clint Eastwood Lee Van Cleef and someone else (Is he supposed to be Eli Wallach? Franco Nero? Its not very clear) who are confronted by Stranger Its an amusing in-joke for fans of Sergio Leone fans and spaghetti western aficionados but I imagine no one else would see the point
Undoubtedly the least among the Spaghetti Westerns Ive been watching lately: basically a low-brow rip-off of Leones THE GOOD THE BAD AND THE UGLY (1966) with three disparate characters outwitting one another (and occasionally forming shaky alliances) in their search for hidden gold Leonard Maltin rated it a BOMB; while its harmless enough its also totally routine and fatally the three main roles are stereotypes that is to say uninteresting: Eddie Byrnes is a bank employee with ideas regarding his consignment being transported by train; Gilbert Roland is the legendary but ageing Mexican bandit (his frequent lapses into Spanish when excited are quite corny!) who apparently is still irresistible to women; George Hilton as an enigmatic bounty hunter tries too hard to emulate Clint Eastwoods Man With No Name figure Director Castellari - whom I saw at the Italian B-movie retrospective held during the 2004 Venice Film Festival where he came off as the most pompous of the cult movie directors present! - shows little genuine feeling for the Western (on the strength of two above-average Franco Nero efforts in the genre I ordered his collaboration with Castellari KEOMA [1976]Im keeping my fingers crossed now!) and the films tongue-in-cheek approach is equally lamentable
The film begins with a dandy gunfight where three bandits are quickly gunned down by a bounty hunter--a bounty hunter who bears more than just a superficial to the Man With No Name from the Clint Eastwood trilogy (FISTFUL OF DOLLARS FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE and THE GOOD THE BAD AND THE UGLY)br br Immediately after you see this man in a gold train filled with Union soldiers Naturally the shipment is attacked and the soldiers all fight like blind guys so they are quickly neutralized However in a twist one of the bandits cheats the gang leader (Gilbert Roland) and rides away with the gold Soon Roland catches up and is about to find out where the gold is hidden But just at that moment the army turns up and kills the traitorbummer However the Man With No Name wannabe thinks Roland knows about the treasure and perhaps a medallion given to Roland by the traitor holds the key A strange banker also is thrown into the mix All three want the gold and all three seem pretty machobr br Overall this is not a particularly distinguished Western Much of it is the plot some of it is that George Hilton (a Uruguayan despite the American sounding name) isnt as interesting as Eastwood or some of the other premier Spaghetti Western stars but most of it is because the soundtrack simply sucks So often the music doesnt even come close to matching the acting and it seems almost randomly added Plus it just isnt very good stuff as well This clearly isnt the work of Ennio Morricone--music master of the Spaghetti genrebr br Overall just a time passer--and not a particularly good one to boot
Lately Ive been watching a lot of westerns from the 1930s to the present There are some great low budget spaghetti westerns from the late 1960s and early 1970s This movie had all the elements of a decent western: a good story with talented actors and everything else Although its a spoof of this genre and for me the way it was done just didnt work and made for a disappointing moviebr br This movie can easily be divided into two partsbr br The first part is great; it has a great opening scene and an interesting story develops of a bounty hunter (aka the stranger) going after a bandit who is going after a large bank shipment guarded in part by a banker Over the course of the movie these three characters form shifting alliances in an attempt to get the money There are subtle comic nods to the contrivances of earlier films from this genre but the comedy doesnt disrupt the overall storybr br The second half of the film is where the comedy goes over-the-top and essentially ruins the movie The turning point is right at the part where the barmaid causally scolds the dwarf to stop shooting the customers as she goes about waiting on other patrons seemingly oblivious to the four dead bodies laying about the place From this point onward the movie shifts from a decent spaghetti western with comic undertones to a stupid-silly spoofbr br There are three horrible fist-fight scenes (one at the river one in the market and one at the baths) that follow in rapid succession as if one wasnt bad enough The fighting is so fake its ridiculous and since the sound is out-of-sync with the picture it makes it even worse In the market fight scene the banker bounces about the place on hidden trampolines and twirls around on poles like he is in the circus; its clownish Although the worst part of these fight scenes is the music; its this light-hearted sprightly mix more suited for a square dance or a cheesy episode of Hee-Haw These scenes practically derail the main storybr br Overall this movie was disappointing because it had a lot of potential as a decent western but the comic turns just mucked it up If you want to see a good western spoof then see Blazing Saddles If you want to see a good spaghetti western then avoid this movie
Theres considerable amount of money behind this production so the look of it is very good It includes some interesting appearances by Gilbert Roland Eddie Burns and a brief cameo at the beginning by Christopher Lee There are a few exciting gunfights and a humorous bit or two - the satire on Django the Man with No Name and Sabata is amusing especially when they are given the names of failed presidents of the Mexico revolutionbr br The trouble is there isnt any purpose in satirizing the Spaghetti Western as is attempted here The key element in the Spaghettis is IRONY which easily blends into comedy; in fact the source of all Spaghettis is Kurosawas Yojimbo which is universally recognized as one of the great black comedies of all time and most Spaghettis easily slipped over the edge into real comedy of a very sophisticated variety Perhaps the best evidence of this is found in the Trinity films which are both openly Spaghettis and openly slap-stick comedy So why bother satirizing a genre that - by its very nature - satirizes itself? Consequently I found the whole enterprise essentially unconvincing None of these characters were people I would ever care about the story was generically cliché and the production values only reflected the money involved not the passion of the director Over all a banal and futile effort to cash in on the phenomenon it mocks
I honestly dont know where to begin when reviewing a movie as pathetic as Ernest Goes to Africa Aside from two or three good laughs dispersed throughout the film there is nothing positive about this hour-and-a-half waste of time and life It is incredible that someone was able to round up a group of people willing to act film and edit this piece of trash and even more incredible that this is the eighth installment in the Ernest seriesbr br During the opening credits of the movie we see Ernest posing next to various African objects such as wooden masks and the heads of African animals making faces and gestures that would probably make most 3rd graders laugh This opening scene gives the viewer a taste of Ernests frequent attempts at humor and demonstrates how his comedy falls flat 95% of the timebr br The first thing that really hit me about this movie is how bad the acting is Everyone in the film is a typical C-movie actor but Linda Kash stands out as especially terrible She is the epitome of overacting; all of her lines are delivered with shockingly inhuman enthusiasm that youd find only in a middle school play Most high school theater students probably could have replaced these actors and delivered a more powerful performance Jim Varney at least displays some comedic ability every now and then but for the majority of the movie he just acts like a complete retard trying to be humorous by making stupid faces and speaking in different voicesbr br Ernest Goes to Africa begins in Africa where an archaeologist has stolen two priceless gems from an African tribe The gems then make their way back to the United States where an unidentified man is seen running from several henchmen through a flea market He hides them in a bucket of two for a dollar items and then runs from the scene Ernest is looking for a gift to buy for Rene a waitress he likes so he goes to the flea market and of course buys the priceless gems He later takes them back to his house paints them and glues them together to make a yo-yo He gives the yo-yo to Rene and she explains that they can never be together because he is just an average shmoe and she wants a man of adventure Rene and Ernest are tracked down by the henchmen and are then brought to Africa to be kept as prisonersbr br Most of the movie really doesnt make sense Once Ernest is in Africa he falls out of the truck that they are carrying him in and lands in a river In the next scene we see him as a Hindu servant named Hey You His skin is dark and he is wearing a loin cloth At first I thought Jim Varney was playing another role in the film in addition to Ernest but I immediately recognized Ernests idiocy once Hey You began to speakbr br Another scene that sticks out in my mind as being completely ridiculous is the car chase scene in the African wilderness Rene and Ernest have taken an ostrich farmers truck and are being chased by the henchmen Driving at about twenty miles per hour on a fairly straight road both henchmen are shooting at Ernest who is in the back of the ostrich farmers truck Ernest on the other hand is throwing ostrich eggs at the henchmen and their driver The henchmen never hit Ernest once during the five minute chase but Ernest is able to fend them off by hitting them and their driver in the face making their car swerve off the road and explode in a giant column of smoke I should also add that Ernest is slingshotting the eggs two at a time from a large brabr br The set design is also incredibly poor in this movie There is a large portion of the film in which Rene and Ernest are walking in Africa trying to find civilization During their hike we see them walking through fields and jungles which probably could have been shot anywhere in the United States The fields are simply plain grassy fields with no indication whatsoever of being anywhere near Africa (they could have at least digitally added some African trees in the background) and the jungles look like the woods of rural Connecticut with papier mâchè skulls vines and thorns hanging from trees According to IMDbcom the film was actually shot in South Africa but I still wouldnt believe that at allbr br The movie goes on and on Ernest joke after Ernest joke The rest of the movie doesnt really make any sense either; the African tribesmen all speak English for some reason and Ernest is later challenged to a Battle of Truth by the lead henchman who is suddenly dressed in an outfit that resembles that of a ninja yet also somewhat resembles that of a bondage submissive The henchman has a table of axes swords knives and maces before him while Ernest has a table with a sandwich a teddy bear and a few other worthless items However Ernest wins the battle and somehow ends up saving the daybr br Overall this movie is painful to watch I couldnt handle it in one sitting; I had to stop halfway through and do something productive for a few hours to compensate for the brain cells lost while trying to appreciate Varneys humor They should really put a Surgeons General Warning on the box to let people know that they will in fact be slightly more retarded upon finishing this movie I would have to say that out of all the movies I have ever seen none comes close to being as pitiable as Ernest Goes to Africa
OK so one night me and some friends decided to get really stoned and watch a movie Unfortunately for us we chose Ernest Goes to Africa I have never laughed so hard in my entire life This movie is beyond bad I have literally pooped out better films than Ernest Goes to Africa (I poop films) br br The highlight of this movie for me at least was the opening sequence when Ernest is making silly faces When they showed him with a head the size of a peanut I lost it Perhaps I found this so funny because at that point I was the most high Perhaps you are rightbr br If I had to guess what George W Bushs favorite movie is I would guess Ernest Goes to Africa Never before have I seen a movie rely more on 1950s stereotypes of people of color There were times when words escaped me and I just stared in awebr br As I was watching this I couldnt help but wonder is this movie meant for children? Do literate adults actually watch this? How could there possibly be a whole franchise of Ernest movies? Is this really my life? Is this real? br br I hated this movie
Having first read the novel I dont mindfor the purposes of filming how differently it is scripted as long as it adheres to or at least includes the plot For reasons known only to Hollywood important parts of the story are completely ignored and a different story line added The reason this novel passed the test of time is no doubt due to the interweaving of both the characters and plot as a whole To interfere with this structure is to destroy the intricate balance of the story line and therefore the intension of the story teller Although a matter of opinion the casting of this film leaves a lot to be desired Characters described as very fat should at least be made to look portly to allow for the character to have credibility The days of slavery cant be over or surely actors of this calibre would have been in revolt at such a travesty of the story The face of Marian Halcolme is described as being manly in appearance Tara Fitzgeralds very feminine appearance doesnt ring true Again Laura Fairly is described as being fair if not ethereal so with dark hair she does not quite fit the impression gleaned from the novel Badly done Hollywood!br br J Hunter
This is supposed to be based on Wilkie Collins _The_Woman_In_White_ but the only resemblance it bore to that story were the characters names the time period and the settings If they were going to change the story so thoroughly I dont understand why they needed to keep up the pretense that it came from Wilkie Collins Go read the book Its much better
An awful travesty of the Greek resistance Senorita Cruz badly miscast as a Cephalonian Greek girl (there are plenty of attractive good English speaking Greek actresses so why pick a Spanish lady for one of the leading roles and with an English actor as her father supposedly a Greek doctor!? Many of the supporting cast are well known actors and actresses from Greek theatre and TV series The only foreign actor to my knowledge who has successfully portrayed a Greek was Anthony Quinn (as the Macedonian lignite miner Zorba in Zorba the Greek as the plutocratic shipowner in the Greek Tycoonand as a Greek colonel in the Guns of Navaronebr br There is some historical truth reflected in the film People who remember the Italian occupation of the Ionian Islands agree that the Italians were not harsh unlike the Germans who succeeded them Also Mussolinis forces as hinted in the movie had been defeated by the Greek army in the Albanian campaign After the Germans intervened in the Balkans they allowed the Italian military to occupy certain parts of Greece so the refusal of the local government to surrender to Italian forces rather than to the Germans as portrayed in the film is quite plausible although I am not certain this actually happened
In 4 words Captain Corellis Mandolin was completely out of tune with the book The novel provided sufficient character background to understand the relationships and personal challenges the characters needed to overcome; the script writer chose to ignore the details In ignoring them (eg the priests role initially as a buffoon but later as a spiritual leader the fiancees inability to read until taught by a socialist rebel the bomb experts advice to Corelli and his eventual ironic demise) the story and characters fall flatbr br This was the first movie that Ive ever walked out of midway through Interesting cinematography great actors do not MAKE a film; the story does
I give it a 2 because of the beautiful Mediterranean Greece otherwise it would be 1 When Nicholas Cage came into with his first lines I thought he was just kidding Cage as an Italian ?? Im sorry but very wrong actor whos acting is also BAD not to mention his Italiano accent The story is very loose it might have been good but with other actors and obviously with other screenplay The camera is great photography also but why the hell did you cast Nicholas Cage and Penelope Cruz for the role Please dont get me wrong I dont have anything against Cage he has some really great movies but he obviously isnt for every role Its really a pity that the cast wasnt better set because the story has potential
I actually was looking forward to this movie After reading a number of reviews before the release it sounded like a genuinely nice film one that was beautifully filmed and one with an interesting cast (Nicholas Cage Penelope Cruz and John Hurt)br br Well it might have been all of those things BUT it is so boring that I defy almost anyone to sit through this in its entirety and keep attention Also Cages attempt at speaking with an Italian accent is embarrassingly bad Hes such a good actor that I cringed every time he spoke in this film br br Disappointing seems to be the most-often word used by reviewers here to describe this film and I totally agreebr br I guess it didnt take long for word to get out about how bad this movie was because like Cages accent it did not do well
1st watched 3172002 - 2 out of 10(Dir-Mario Pinzauti): Silly sex-filled master & slave having too many intimate relations movie This movie seemed to care more about the sex than the story and kind of worked the story around the sex Laughable dubbing of the original Italian language in the version I watched with ridiculous ending where the attempt is made to give an anti-slave statement(or should I say one line) What a waste of time for everyone who watches this trash
Italian rip off of Mandingo and The Drum is a badly dubbed Italian life on the plantation yarn Lots of people who dont look like they belong in the American South wear badly tailored costumes and wander around locations that look nothing like the American south The plot has something about the romance between a rich man and a certain young woman the jealousy that ensues and the tragedy that follows The film promises hot steamy sex and lots of twisted violence but nothing ever really comes of any of it its all tease Its all probably racially insensitive I couldnt notice since its artistically bankrupt The final twist is at best laughable A major turkey
Trading on the success of the 1975 hit this film is a cheaply made story of a plantation where Massa gets down with the slave women and the Missus gets down with the big black stud and with massaa son also In fact there is so much getting down going on that I really dont know why anyone bothered to get dressedbr br So if you want to see white women rolling their naked bodies all over tied up slaves or you just like a movie with tits on display every five minutes then this one is for youbr br There is a funnysad story in here but it only comes at the very end so as to not interfere with all the hot sweaty sex going on on the plantation
The Italians are undeniable masters in the questionable art of ripping off and imitating movies What they do is take an innovative money-making and foreign concept maintain the basic plot and just add a whole lot of action sleaze and political incorrectness But what to do when the non-Italian original is already a reputedly notorious film and quite difficult to surpass in terms of slop and controversy? Well then I guess you simply disregard everything in terms of story-building or stylishness and fully focus on making something that is practically a porno movie! This Italian turkey was inspired by Richard Fleischers successful slavery-saga Mandingo released one year earlier but since the makers were even too lazy to think up a different title you shouldnt expect anything that even remotely resembles a narrative depth character drawings unsettling atmosphere or thought-provoking statements regarding cross cultural relationships MandingA is pure and simply a sexploitation effort where the plot only develops itself throughout the last ten minutes in other words when you stopped caring a long time ago already The characters in this film are a gathering of despicable bastards which is of course to expect when youre dealing with wealthy and obnoxious white folks running a plantation in South America The elderly and supremely sleazy owner of the place is a widower (who probably also won a couple of Moustache-of-the-Year awards) who exploits and extendedly whips the slaves working for him His mistress who if I understood correctly is also his cousin (?) is a genuine bitch of a woman who enjoys provoking arguments and sneaks out of the house overnight to copulate with crucified slaves When the plantation owners son returns from Europe after approximately 25 minutes of purely wasted running time the plot slightly begin to develop itself at last The handsome young man has sex with the bitchy woman a couple of times (even in front of the slaves supposedly to demonstrate how their masters do it) but eventually he falls in love with the cherubic preachers daughter His romantic preference obviously makes the bitchy woman mad with anger and she plots a horribly cruel act of vengeance that will alter life on the plantation forever Hey  I just realized this brief description of the plot actually makes Mandinga sound like an interesting film! Well its NOT and I apologize if I raised anyones anticipations Its an incredibly boring and hideous film to struggle through but if the themes appeal to you then definitely check out the aforementioned Mandingo Much rather than sick exploitation that film is a truly insightful portrait of one of mankind darkest history pages and it was also a properly produced film with real actors great music and impressive filming locations Mandinga has nothing absolutely nothing to offer
This was a mish mash of a film that started out going nowhere got lost on the way then suddenly found a plot in the last 5 minutes when the title character is FINALLY introduced There were so many ugly mutton-chopped guys in this film I lost track of who was the owner and who were the overseers I have a theory about the casting though; all the bad guys were played by ugly actors (and one ugly actress) and all the good guysvictims were played by beautiful actors Indeed the actors who played the ultimate victims the slaves were gorgeous as was the innocent priests daughter while the plantation owner his minipulative mistress and his overseers were pretty hard on the eyes On purpose? You make the callbr br I hung in there till the end and some others might be able to make it as well If you just want to look at bare breasts there are plenty of them here and if you have a slavemaster fetish then youll love this film Otherwise watch it once vomit shower and never speak of it to anyone
When I first looked at the back of the cover of this film it seemed like me and my friends could be looking forward to 82 memorable minutes And it certainly was memorable Puckoon was the kind of movie where you keep asking yourself how this was possible How it was possible that it was released on DVD at all Out of all of the movies available at the video rental store that nightwe might just have picked the worst And yes they had Tomb Raider Absolutely nothing in this movie amused me even slightly Who came up with the idea that it would be funny if the narrator could change the story by suggestions from the main character? Out of all the stupid things you can totally ruin a movie with this is now my favourite The character Foggerty the village idiot played by Nickolas Grace is the most annoying character since they started making movies in color If there is one single movie that you definately not should see this year please let it be Puckoon cause I dont think it can be any worse I still wonder if this just might have been the worst way I have spent my money and take my word for that I have made many lousy purchases over the years
technically this movie would have had it all: decent actors a nice landscape no obvious sights of a lack of budget a celebrity like richard attenborough the plot summary also sounded promising suggesting a satire on silly bureaucracy and common people outwitting itbr br however it never delivers the plot is simply too illogical throughout the whole movie not one person does a single sensible thing mad politicians ridiculous soldiers brain-dead villagers - all just hustle from one incredible situation to the next what they all do never makes sense in a context beyond the current scenebr br of course this kind of movie has to be absurd and exaggerated however its also supposed to have at least one instance to point out the madness behind splitting a city in the middle actually there are (at least) two attempts which unfortunately fail: the main character who doesnt seem to have a clue about whats happening to him and the writer who occasionally cracks jokes from the off that might be considered funny by an audience consisting solely of 12 year oldsbr br what i found most impressing is that the movie tries to be funny all the time but didnt made me laugh once ive seen several bad funny movies but until yet every single one of them featured at least 2 or 3 good laughs so in this sense puckoon is really remarkablebr br if you want to see a great movie with a comparable plot check out brazil dont waste your time on puckoon
Spike Milligan was one of the funniest men Ive ever seen and a huge influence on my lifebr br This movie is limp and awful and does his memory no credit The script is cluttered and preserves too many lines from the book intact (the leg jokes here are incomprehensible) The actors performances are uniformly ineffective a great cast wasted and the lead Sean Hughes delivers Milligans belligerent hostilities in a plaintive whine which misses the point completelybr br The gentle pacing is a killer as well Farce should accelerate towards the end The Goon Shows often did the novel Puckoon definitely did but this film if anything slows down just when you want the various elements to smash together in a final climaxbr br Milligan narrated an abridged audio recording of Puckoon in 1980 with TP McKenna Dermot Kelly Norma Ronald and Jack Hobbs Now thats funny Ten minutes of that is funnier than this whole film I believe the LP was transferred to CD but dont know if its still in printbr br There is a movie of Adolf Hitler: My Part in his Downfall with Jim Dale and Arthur Lowe It too is a godawful mess but its funnier than this thingbr br Its possible that Milligans spirit is too rambunctious for the screen The other reviewers here are indulging in politeness and wishful thinking This film fumbles virtually every opportunity and never misses a chance to disappoint
Okay now I am pretty sure that my summary got your attention and my commenting that Zazu Pitts is Satan is not without some basis Let me explain The film at first appears to be a dandy B-movie about an evil organization called the Crooked Circle and their vow of revenge in the form of murder on a rival organization dedicated to solving crimes While this is very odd (especially the idea of a club of private citizens who solve crimes) and COULD have been interesting this film falls apart despite a rather impressive list of familiar supporting actors Why? Well because Zazu Pitts (never one of my favorite actresses) spends most of the movie whining just like Olive Oyl with a bad toothache!! While murders are being committed people are being kidnapped or whatever you can always count on Zazu whining at full volume--almost like someones obnoxious 3 year-old who wants everyone at a party to pay attention to her! At the same time shes NOT an integral part of the film but received top billing Why she is even there is beyond me--I assume its just to whine and yell As a result I found the movie practically unwatchable and it was completely ruined Now you probably know why I referred to this actress of dubious talent as Satan! Im sure that when the actors in this film saw the final product they too felt pretty much the same way I did about her horrible overacting and amateurish performancebr br This film is in the public domain and can be found for free download on the internet I can see why
Even those of us who like cute animal pictures --- and I abhor them ---would be hard pressed to find any merit in this abysmally bad travesty of a film Perhaps inspired by 101 Dalmatians with its smart and loyal dogs its dumb and devious humans and its absurdly happy and predictable ending the alternate title 101 Turkeys springs to mind That would just about cover everyone involved in its unfortunate production I dismissed it as some inane Hollywood perversion of British customs before learning to my horror that it actually is a Canadian film done in Victoria BC that phony British theme park of a town while sucking tax dollars out of Ottawa ON that equally phony pit of Canadian mediocrity Let me count the ways it is bad The dizzy plot? The asinine script? The dismal performances and sophomoric direction? The cloyingly clever animals? The endless clichés and predictable slapstick? On second thought neither I nor those browsing the IMDb have time for a complete catalogue of its failings Yet were I to detail its merits this space would remain blank Trust me it is bad; a signal monument in the vast pantheon of truly terrible (Canadian) cinema If you have seen it already my condolences If you have not stay away from it as you would SARS or bubonic plague Or other movies with cute animals Dont even let your children see it lest their tiny minds be warped by the even tinier minds of those who financed fabricated and filmed this frightful folly Perhaps tonight when I retire I will have a nightmare with ghastly fanged beasts springing from the bed table as I flee in frantic flight I hope so It will be a far far better thing I do than watch this beastly banal boondoggle But then I might dream that I had to watch it a second time and the sheer terror and cold sweat of that makes me want to stay up all night trembling at the very possibility of seeing it again even as a bad dream I might even find something worthwhile to watch in its stead Maybe Godzilla or Attack Of The Killer Tomatoes Perhaps the instruction video for my built in vacuum cleaner
The Duke is a film based in the heart of the British aristocracy where an old Duke (John Neville) dies and to avoid his large property and the vast riches to be taken from him after death by 2 devious aristocrats (Oliver Muirhead and Sophie Heyman); he passes his Dukeship down to his dog The dogs best friend an American girl named Charlotte (played by Courtnee Draper) whose parents die becomes orphaned by the former Duke due to him being her great uncle A young chef named Florian arrives with him and Charlotte instantly connecting creating a romantic sub-plot which in its own way acts as the under tone for the main plot line being the activities of Hubert The Duke and his many activities and love interests with other dogs All this is watched over by James Doohan who plays a Butler who is determined to try and serve his old Duke by doing his best to serve his new master Hubert Doohan acts as the older character there to comfort and advise the younger ones whilst he over looks and performs various ridiculous tasks under his new master A fine comedic performance mixed with elements of drama to end the career of a fine and influential actorbr br Though from the technical viewpoint I dislike this film as I only watched upon discovering James Doohans role Though the plot is good elements of the writing and directing have to be obscured Ignoring the absurdity of a Doggie Duke I personally dislike the over use of comedic and outrageous jokes upon the bad characters due to their ludicrousness The dependence on hygiene related humour as you like is much too apparent and general silliness of many characters doesnt appeal to me The director Phillip Spink uses mid-long shots too often with either an overdubbed voice or affecting the overall sound quality Plus the acting of Muirhead and Heyman whilst good at the dramatic and romantic sequences fall drastically short fulfilling the wholesale requirements regarding the rolebr br But as a mature movie fan I find it easy to be over critical of a simple family film designed to make you laugh I can admit I found certain bits funny and other bits touching along with a plot that may be far-fetched but has definite connections I do not recommend this film to mature movie fans but I do highly recommend it to Dog lovers families who wish to enjoy a funny film for their child and James Doohan fans who wish to see Scotty in his final role
I had the misfortune of seeing this crapulous effort on television a few years ago Suffice it to say Michael Gross phones in his performance and Hasselhoff is the least convincing thiefpsychoEVER! If you have a couple of hours to kill watch it and prepare to laugh
Nothing special to see here the animation has being outdated and the plot is a typical futuristic era This film has an original story but if it doesnt have an original plot or characters so in my opinion its not worth seeing Im not saying that the movie was bad it was just a typical anime story and I thought I watched this movie like a thousand times So if you are looking for something original see another thing
Sylvester the cat stowaway upon a ship that Tweety bird happens to be on with his owner Granny Oh I dont even have enough words to convey how much I disdain both the Tweety and Granny characters They simply are not funny to me and made this short quite the chore to sit through indeed Sylvester is a great character on his own but theres only so much he can do when confronted by the sheer awfulness of that accursed bid and senile old witch of a Granny This animated short can be found on disc 4 of the Looney Tunes Golden Collection Volume 1 and features an optional commentary by Micheal Barrierbr br My Grade: D+
Opening with some blatantly reused footage from Kit for Cat Tweetys SOS fails to live up to that classic cartoon Instead we get an example of Friz Frelengs Tweety and Sylvester series at its most generic Unlike Chuck Joness Road Runner series which strived to introduce new jokes to the same setting Frelengs series seemed happy enough to recycle jokes as long as the characters were in a different place Tweetys SOS then basically amounts to this time lets put em on a boat Its not an entirely weak cartoon There are a few good jokes mostly involving Grannys glasses but they are outweighed by gags you can see coming a mile off (the seasickness routine) and it all builds to another of those endings where someone else other than Tweety says I tawt I taw a putty tat a joke that worked well once but has diminishing returns Tweetys SOS will probably please children who enjoy virtually any cartoon but for big kids like me who are looking for more than the same tired gags its definitely one to avoid
I happened to catch this movie on late night TV I saw the opening credits and thought this looks good Well I was very wrong While not excruciatingly bad (it had some funny and tender moments)it lacked any sense of cohesionbr br It started off well enough with Kathy Batescharacter having a midlife crisis of sorts when her husband leaves her and her singing idol is murdered But Kathy has played these disaffected women so well before - think Fried Green Tomatoes The problem wasnt Kathy it was the clueless screenplay that wandered all over the place It was as if the writers must have been thinking what will we do next The script also felt very contrivedbr br Some others who have posted comments on this movie have wondered why it didnt receive a cinematic release The main reason I think would have been to avoid embarrassment and the critics would have murdered itbr br Having said all that I thought the small woman who played Maudie was fantastic and stole the movie not to mention how beautiful she is
This movie was produced by the biggest producer in Costa Rica Although their authors brag about it as a the biggest movie in Costa Rica ever made and their actors even dare to say that they didnt get an Oscar Nomination due to its political relevance with oil (-he he right) Well this is all a lie This movie was supposedly based on a book written by Carlos Salazar Herrera about a love triangle (super cliché soap opera-like subject) and it secondary story is about an oil problem on the Atlantic Coast of Costa Rica with an American oil company who wanted to explore oil deposits on the region but at the end it never was approved by the government Now it may have some nice footage about the beaches but thats it; nothing bigger than that it is all in the camera Most of the actors are lousy except for two or three The rest lack of sense of what acting means: they overact most of the time The story is completely common and cliché worthy of a cheap Mexican soap opera as I said because the crew advertised it as a protest movie about oil but 80% of the movie is based on a stupid love triangle The script is nothing impressing it is very simple and the dialogs are not very thought It has also got some editing problem on a couple of scene changes but besides that is pretty decent The director did an alright job I mean he is not like an Oliver Stonebut he did his job with the resources he had handy I would like to question him why instead of using Costarican actor he spent most of the money on foreign ones I mean after all they bragged about being an 100% Costarican Production thats what you at least expect Final the end is is not well done there are flaws and details that dont match or are useless Besides being the most elaborated movie in all Costarican history I think its mediocre You can make way more interesting and better pictures with less cash Never heard of Pi? Anyway if you are curious about Costa Rican or Central American movies this one will do but you are definitively not missing anything
I have just seen Caribe a couple of nights ago at the annual Vistas Film Festival held here in Dallas and I must express my discontent The opening caption tries to tell us that the film is a portrayal of the current invasion of South American countries (Costa Rica in this particular case) by North American oil companies and the negative effects both economic and environmental of this invasion The main characters are a married couple who live a simple pleasant life maintaining a banana farm Right away a woman arrives and announces that she is the wifes half-sister Im not going to go into specifics about this (and to be honest I dont feel that Im spoiling anything with this review) yet another key point is that the company to whom they distribute their bananas drops them due to budget demands in a poor economy So the main conflict that is supposed to be addressed in the movie is of the husband between the rock and the hard place trying to preserve his livelihood On one hand the Reynolds oil company has basically offered him employment and financial compensation (basically a bribe) to use his public influence to encourage the town to allow the company to begin drilling in their town (compromising his standing with the community and the community itself) On the other hand he is faced with being dead broke but on the side of his community protesting the drilling Given the length of this film it would have been ample time to explore the issues just described but it just doesnt happen and Ill tell you why You will notice that this film has won a couple of awards so far one for direction and an audience award Im not going to pick apart Estebans direction it wasnt bad or good enough for me to be all that passionate about writing anything The audience award was at a film festival in Spain and for it to gain an audience award Id have to imagine that Spanish people just dig soap operas In fact Central and South America dig soap operas as well I know that much I assume that Esteban was either aiming to take advantage of this or that he himself digs soap operas because that is what unfolds over the course of this film so much to the point that it kicks the whole oil company plot to the side almost as if they imagined halfway through the making of this film that it had become tiresome because it seems like at least three of the supporting characters have had their back story and character development severely compromised to make room for more sex and crying scenes The only true villain in the movie is one of these three characters and at no point do you actually get to find out who the hell he is Its almost as if they cut his screen time just short of taking him out of the film entirely From time to time they toy with the oil against community plot but these are digressions at best What we see a lot more of are scenes of passion jealousy betrayal adultery etc These themes saturate the story to such a degree that the oil company subplot becomes unnecessary Its almost as if this was a stunt to legitimize a romantic drama (soap opera) by throwing in a little political relevance Nevertheless the film gets so caught up in the romance that it ultimately doesnt know what to do with itself resulting in an ending so tacked on that youre left wondering what it is that youve been waiting around for or if there was ever anything to begin with Here are two things that I think could have saved this movie: either cut out the half-sister or cut out the oil company Its obvious which one of the two they were more interested in Or perhaps if Caribe had been an hour longer they could have worked this all out Regardless Id have been fine with a straight-up soap opera and I think that the subject of oil companies exploiting foreign nations is in dire need of addressing by the film community Caribe is both and neither These two angles could have worked together had they been balanced accordingly but with a romantic plot running around in circles and taking up almost twice as much time as necessary at the expense of an oil plot thats barely been established to begin with both sides suffer Best of all the romance plot is never even resolved Id like to say Id watch this movie again to see what Ive missed but I have a strong feeling that I already know what it is As far as Im concerned it wouldnt matter if I saw Caribe ten more times Ive missed it because it is simply not there
This movie has to be one of the most boring and stupid movies that Perrugorria have done br br It looks like a commercial from beginning to end The ¨director¨spent the whole time on a tripod it doesnt have pace rhythm Its illogical what a mess You can tell whats gonna happen since the first 15 minutes and the endingWowbr br ------spoiler-------br br Jesus Christ how the hell Perrugorria got shot? Are you serious? Worst scene of someone getting shot ever!br br ------end of spoiler-----br br Bad directing bad script bad actingReally bad overall I wouldnt recommend this movie at all Its a waste of money and time
Mom begins at night in the middle of nowhere at what looks like a wooden building in the desert A pick-up truck pulls up & an angry Father chucks his slutty daughter Virginia Monroe (Claudia Christian) out & leaves her there but she isnt alone as the shadowy figure of Nestor Duvalier (Brion James) watches her from a short distance Virginia tries to make conversation but as she grinds a cigarette out under her Leopard print thigh high high heeled boots Nestor grabs her by her throat & drags her off into the darkness Nestor then rips her top open turns into a monster & starts to eat her innards Virginia is the latest victim of a serial killer that have Lieutenant Carlo Hendrix (Art Evans) & the LAPD baffled or at least thats the message a local TV news reporter named Clay Dwyer (Mark Thomas MIller) is telling his viewers Clay is happily living with his pregnant girlfriend Alice (Mary Beth McDonough) & therefore his Mother Emily (Jeanne Bates) has a spare room going which she decides to rent out to the blind dark sunglass wearing Nestor Unfortunately for Emily she accidentally knocks Nestors sunglasses off which reveal he has strange coloured eyes Nestor then turns into a monster again & bites Emily turning her into a flesh-eating monster just like himself Nestor takes Emily out to train her they find a suitable homeless bum (Rory VanSaint) murder him & eat his guts but Emilys son Clay has witnessed the whole thing & he must choose between doing what is right & his love for his Mother who now just happens to be a grotesque bloodsucking & flesh-eating monster!br br Edited written & directed by Patrick Rand I thought Mom was a pretty awful film Looking at some of the other comments on the IMDb & the genre listing it has been given it appears many seem to think that Mom is a comedy horror Well I can tell you now that I didnt see any comedic elements in Mom at all because there arent any unless they are very subtle The only thing that I can assume is that people see comedy in the actual situation which Mom presents that being an old lady turning into a flesh-eating monster & the predictable problems & emotional angst that it causes to her son who finds out There are no jokes (apart from naming a prostitute Beverly Hills (Stella Stevens)) slapstick humour or anything even remotely funny in the film itself & as far as I could see it is played totally straight throughout its 90 minute run time So with there being no comedy in Mom that must mean theres lots of horror right? Wrong Mom sucks & is painfully slow to watch especially after the first thirty odd minutes which consist of Nestor turning into a monster a couple of times biting Emily showing her how to hunt for food & Clay finding out Until this point Mom was moving at a fairly decent pace had some OK special make-up effects & had me interested unfortunately Mom runs for another hour which is basically the emotional crap suffered by Emilys Son the eventual breakdown of his marriage & him being torn between love for his Mother & the fact that shes a flesh-eating monster This part of the film is incredibly slow boring & as dull as dishwater even having the nerve to resort to a clichéd role-reversal scenario where Clay tells his Mom to go to her room & stay there locking the door behind her telling her off & putting bars over her window so she cant escape her room Moms script totally ignores the monsters origins & asks us to just accept that this thing exists without giving a single reason why we should no matter how silly an explanation might have been I think some background to the monster would have helped Technically Mom is bland & cheap looking although I cant say its badly made its very average stuff all the way with nothing that particularly impresses or anything with which I could make fun of to pass the time The special make-up effects on the monster are OK but their used in very quick flashes blink & youll miss them Dont be fooled by any fancy video box artwork like I was the monster is only in it three times maximum & all of those are within the pacey first thirty minutes There isnt much gore either a severed arm some brief intestine eating a burnt body & a drill in someones arm is all we get The acting is OK but please Mr Brion James what is that dodgy accent all about!? At least James had the good sense to know he was in crap & sensibly opted to be killed off early on in the proceedings everyone else are nobodies expect the black Lieutenant who was also a black police officer in Fright Night (1985) but you may recognise him from Die Hard 2 (1990) he made Mom & Die Hard 2 in the same year?! Talk about opposite ends of the spectrum! Overall there is nothing by which I can really recommend Mom as a horror film & it certainly isnt a comedy as far as Im concerned Very poor very disappointing & yet again Ive been conned by fancy video-box artwork with lots of stills of cool looking monsters Definitely one to avoid
Lame B-horror that takes itself too damn seriously considering its subject matter concerns an aging old dear who has been turned into a creature of the night by a lodger who has come to rent a room from her When said lodger is killed off Mom has to go out to feed on her own and that causes some family strain and also garners some attention from the authoritiesbr br My main complaint is that this film should have brought THE FUNNY It failed to do so although it did have some mild gore and schlocky creature makeup effects to keep the B-movie crowd happy Ive seen worse but I wouldnt give this one a rec--4510
This is probably the most uninvolving film Ive ever seen I watched it because I have a soft spot for Leon (everything else Besson has done has been just awful in my opinion with the exception of the script for Wasabi) and Jean Reno Its a testament to just how bad this film is that Reno one of the most charismatic and effortlessly affable actors (admittedly hes just starting out here) cant make this film or the moments in which he is on screen watchablebr br Its all very film-schooly: black and white no dialogue people doing things for no apparent reason people chasing each other while in turn being chased by a shaky camera And predictably none of it is entertainingbr br Its not a French Mad Max as some people have claimed (actually I think they mean Mad Max 2) - that is a superficial comparison based only on the fact that both films have a post-apocalyptic setting and is just the kind of comment youd expect from someone who doesnt know what theyre talking about Mad Max 2 was pulsating Mad Max 2 was exciting Mad Max 2 was worth your time - Le Dernier Combat is none of thesebr br I know its supposed to be cool to like arty black-and-white French films and equally cool to say you saw something in them that other people did not (or you managed to sit through it without feeling drowsy) which is why I wouldnt trust anyone who claims to like Le Dernier Combat because I see nothing of worth in it whatsoever; it asks for so much and gives nothing back I found myself drifting from it after about five minutes and it never did anything to regain my full attention Anyone who can sit through it undistracted isnt human or at the very most is psychotic (Actually theyre probably just trying to seem cool)
Every great romantic comedy needs conflict between the romantic leads to lend suspense anticipation and allure to the plot This story falls completely flat in this area There is no conflict - at least none that would inhibit the eventual joining of the two lead characters and so suspense is flat there is no anticipation and there really is no allure at allbr br The chemistry between Richard Gere and Diane Lane is representative of friendship at best and with the talent of these two particular actors I was quite surprised During the movie I expected them more to play a game of checkers and chat about the weather than see any moving passionbr br While Im a fan of both actors I do believe that the casting in this movie was off - or perhaps the direction was off-base and it impacted their deliveries The writing was very weak which also might have impacted the performances; most certainly the script could have used some help from some Harlequin writers who have real experience putting the heat in romancebr br This movie may be worth watching on a rainy Sunday afternoon but only after its on the cheap shelfbr br (Sorry Diane Ladd and Richard Gere)
This movie is the final straw As two dedicated fans of the romantic comedy this movie has finally made us realise that nothing good has come out of this genre since Love Actually There was nothing good about the film whatsoever It was an affront to love death and everything in between Including horses and beaches There was absolutely no chemistry between the characters This movie took the spark out of Nicholas Sparks Diane Lane cannot act to save her life She was unconvincing in her laugh cry and dance And she needs a better haircut There is no reason to watch this movie Save yourself The romantic comedy is officially dead
We thought this was one of the worst movies ever I had to volunteer to watch the end The romance was not believable; the characters were not developed; the love affair made hardly any sense; it was miscast; and scenery was absolutely stupid because it was either (my opinion) like the ADAMS FAMILY GOES ON VACATIONjust creepy gypsy and cheesy; and the OUTERBANKS does not look typically like those houses on the surf; and who would spend the night in one during a hurricane if it was not theirs Alsoit was not realistic hurrricanes give you plenty of notice to batten down the hatchesbr br Also the friend was superfluous; and did not match the story What did the civil war have to do with the outerbanks anyway? I also have to mention the wardrobedid D Lane have to have a scarfpashminashawl on in every scene? It was overdone She looked good enough to not have to hide things; without making them obvious like with light slacksbr br Lastly I am concerned with the impact on our landfills when everyone has to dispose of this stupid and I mean STUPID movie!!!! Dont fall for the hype on this one!!!!!! We did Not even watchable
Warning: 1 tiny inconsequential spoiler Youre right This was no Bridges of Madison County As soon as the lonely woman and Richard Gere checked into the big empty hotel it was a foregone conclusion something kind of fun would happen The question is: how will it come about? The answer is some stupid connect-the-dots story not worth sitting through In one supposed bonding experience they get drunk and clean out the cupboard of old cans(That was my spoiler) And the next day they put them back LOL It wasnt compelling AT ALL Im an old married lady like the one in the movie and MY friendships are more interesting than HER romance with Richard Gere LOL    It did have that advantage You walk away and go oh brother    even I could have written something more believable than that I guess my life isnt quite as dull as I thought it was if I can scoff at a romance with Richard Gere LOL! And that friend inherited that totally contemporary probably computer-generated mansion resting half in the ocean from her GRANDMOTHER who built it AFTER THE CIVIL WAR??? Maybe her grandmother is Oprah and this was WAY after the Civil War? And yes WHERE WAS THE EMAIL? What alternative universe do these people live in? I never want to see another movie that pretends we dont have email and facebookand texting And OK maybe these people have a horrible aversion to delivering news over the phone but dont ask me to believe anyone in this age of instant communication that someone just drops into your life without calling first
Not quite a bomb? The only thing missing was the enriched uranium Actually the script may have worked if the lead roles had been cast with younger actors but the dramatics of an aging Diane Lane acting as if she was a teenager (or even a twenty-something) was too much to stomach Every time she (Adrienne) would jump into the arms of Richard Gere and then pull both heels up behind her you could almost see the grimace of pain on his face as he was probably thinking Oh my aching backthis babe sure doesnt weight 125 lbs anymore! Anyway both characters were distinctly unlikeable especially Richard Geres: a self absorbed plastic surgeon (Dr Paul Flanner) that was on some kind of soul quest after a botched operation left him with a dead patient (an older woman from a small farm) Then there was her angry husband and son he had to deal with to explain what happened Dr Flanner is on his way to meet said angry husband (at the husbands request) when he meets up with Adrienne She is recently split from her unfaithful husband (shock) and is helping out a friend by watching her beach-front cottage rental Of course thats where Dr Flanner ends up staying and they both end up falling MADLY in love (especially after she finds out he is a rich doctor AND a plastic surgeon) In between romantic interludes and a nauseating songdance routine that Lane (Adrienne) performs while listening to an old LP (no CDs?) they both try to figure how their lives got so totally screwed up Dr Flanner was also not much of a father and has a son (who is also a Dr) who resents him for not being there for him while he was growing up (Naturally Dr Flanner was more interested in his medical career at the time rather than raising an impetuous distracting boy) To make a long (predictable) story short Adrienne helps Dr Flanner face his inner demons as well as confront said angry husband and son of the woman who died on his operating table (after going in for a routine cyst removal of the face) Dr Flanner is FINALLY able to tell the husband (played excruciatingly sympathetic by Scott Glenn) that he is sorry for what happened - even though it was all the fault of that danged anesthesiologist I told him she was too old for that much juice! Glenns character(Robert Torrelson) appears to accept Dr Flanners apology Its hard to tell because his emotional response is so passive by this time that you wonder if if he is even hearing the good Dr at all or thinking about some acreage that he needs to plow Ever more circumspect Dr Flanner then decides he needs to visit his son (who is now practicing medicine pro-bono in a third world country) to mend their relationship Unfortunately that means he must temporarily bid adieu to Adrienne Of course while entertaining the natives in Timbuktu he writes a love letter every hour on the hour to Adrienne (who nearly swoons like a school girl every time she gets one) and tells her that the hardest thing he ever had to do was to tell her goodbye Evidently apologizing to Robert Torrelson for his wifes death was the second hardest thing In the end he gets killed in a freak mud slide (poetic justice as in mud pack?) and she is left with just the memories of what could have beenhopefully no more GereLane sequels!
I had high hopes for this film even though I had not read the book Richard Gere and Diane Lane together--should be good already But the film does not deliver on the promise I kept waiting for more depth to the characters and there wasnt I have no problem with the fact that it only took a weekend for them to fall in love That can happen But we never really get to know the characters I would have liked more focus on them The film reminded me in places of Bridges of Madison County and that film was far better I really felt for the characters in that film and there was a chemistry (much more passion) between Clint Eastwood and Meryl Streep that there wasnt between Gere and Lane Each of them are very good actors in his or her own right Simply not the right movie for them together
Lonely disconnected middle-class housewife in the midst of a divorce seeks solace to reflect on her immediate future At some sort of bed and breakfast by (well literally in the sea) the ocean that for some sort of odd reason she subs for the owner Enter lonely arrogant Richard Gere He is a plastic surgeon He is the only guest at the inn in the sea Diane Lane is the lonely housewife Youll never guess these two fall immediately in love A tropical storm makes them true loversbr br The subplots in this melodrama make little or no sense The locations photography are fine Gere remains one of the most over-rated actors in cinema and does not disappoint Ms Lane mustve needed the money but phones in her part with grace
While I am not a woman I can enjoy a chick flick if its good This one however is beyond bad You have the by the book story girl is getting divorced boy with issues shows up BOOM magic happens and his demons are banished as she realizes her life has a new purposebr br Now while I can believe that kind of thing might happen I am not an idiot It wouldnt happen over a weekend of geriatric rumpy-pumpy it would take time Yet here the producers know they only have 1 hour and 30 minutes so they force the changes of the two to happen I suppose a night of getting hammered and a night of gramps and granny going at it like dogs in heat might be enough if you believed romance novels were the gospel but most people dontbr br Now if that isnt enough the producers remembered that a chick flick needs to make the viewer cry well they tried to make you cry with the two senior citizens getting jiggy with it by failed so how could they hit you again? Why I know lets kill off one of the characters for no good reason at all except that a random death will surely bring a tear to the eye and now lets have the teen daughter magically bond with heart broken mom for no reason besides the fact that it would be nice (completely unreal but who cares)br br So there you have it girl find boy boy find love death finds boy and mom cries what a movie - NOT
This is one of the more unromantic movies I have ever seenbr br Casting: Richard Gere is just too old looking for romantic lead roles anymore Diane looks a bit eager to please and frowning as usual but she seems unconvinced by the romance herself Supporting cast not too memorablebr br Story: The medical drama he has to deal with is unconvincing and is not interesting The story is weak - not enough happens to make a movie about There is nothing new to say or no new way to say it here br br The setting is a little bleak and the house it is set in is unattractive br br NOT destined to be a great one to remember
Here in Australia Nights in Rodanthe is being promoted in the same class as the Notebook Quite frankly what a lot of rotbr br This film is a like a recipe On paper we have all the right ingredients Richard Gere normally perfect in this genre Diane Lane an old favourite from Under Tuscan Sun and Unfaithful ocean side location solitude and yet the movie sucks At the session we went to yesterday afternoon a women next to my wife fell asleep and half way through the movie got up and left! The main problem is there is no build up or credibility to the relationship in the first place And perhaps there are too many long faces and downbeat if you like histories that Gere and Lanes characters bring to the movie Theres hours of those balanced out with perhaps 5 minutes of what we can to see romance! Theres no warmth from Geres character Lane looks dreadful at the start of the movie and all washed out So as the viewer we cannot really connect to the charactersbr br Others here say the book is great Well be it the screenplay direction or production someone here has made a real mess of this movie Its like the scenes and the buildup are a deck of cards except instead of being in the correct order theyve just been thrown together all over the placebr br Very disappointing save your money for when it hits the video shops and even then wait for a good deal when it goes to the weekly rate
Frankly after Cotton club and Unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch Lane and Gere in this film because it is BAD The acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere It was well shot but then again it is a big budget movie It was too predictable even for a chick flick I even knew from the beginning that he was going to die in the end the only thing I didnt know was how Too politically correct Very disappointing The only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful But if you want that watch National geographic I love Lane but Ive never seen her in a movie this lousy As far as Gere goes hes a good actor but he had movies like this so Im not surprised An hour and a half I wish I could bring back
Richard Gere and Diane Lane star in a chick flick romance with the sort of ending I get really angry aboutlets just say its not my cup of tea just like the dime store romances are not my cup of teabr br The plot has a doctor stopping at an inn and meeting a woman that he has a deep but brief affair with He goes off to meet his estranged son and she goes back to her lifebr br Well acted and well made the filmmakers forgot to get a real plot line This is the stuff of dime store romances that makes the women swoon and the men shake their head in disbelief I wouldnt be so adverse to the film as a mindless romance except that the film takes a turn in the final reel that is so out of left field as to be completely unbelievable Why must certain types of movies do stupid things like this? It really ruined it for mebr br If you like romance give it a shot though wait for cable
My husband brought this home from the video store so I could watch something while stuck home sick The sort of sick where you could never concentrate on a book but a sorta silly light romantic flick sounds just right (that and a bowl of chicken soup) Well he meant wellbr br My first thought (as some others post here also) was that the house MUST be fakeits not only isolated alone on the beach but set on moorings into the loose sand and so close to the ocean that the surf waves go directly under the house! This looks so obviously dangerous (in hurricane country in THE FALL) so potentially disastrous that I was sure filmmakers had simply CGId the whole thing (or used movie magic to plunk a cute B&B into the surf)br br But I have to tell you guys thanks to teh interwebs I can say that the house Serendipity is very real is indeed near Rodanthe and except for some window dressing and shrubs appears mostly as it does in the film You can rent it yourself off season for $1710 a week (or about $3850 in summer)! Go for it! Butinterestingly the house has severe problems The second thing that struck me after would be washed away was what about the plumbingelectrical? in that surf? and sure enough Serendipity was condemned for a break in the sanitation caused by overwash from the ocean (They are rebuilding)br br And the house isnt from the Civil War Not to mention that Viola Davis playing cliché black best friend (thankless role for a fine actress last seen in Doubt) is not remotely old enough that her GRANDMOTHER could have built anything in the Civil War! HELLO! that was 150 years ago! Try great-great-GREAT! (In reality Serendipity was built in 1988 laughably recently) br br The basic film is built on a typical Nicholas Sparks weeper which means a lot of coincidence and trite predictable happenstance It is also aimed in a very pandering way towards women -- you know us women who love B&Bs fusty antiques and knick-knackswho dream of romance and guys who look like Richard Gere and dancing in the moonlight Dont give us plot or thoughtful character development; just set up some mechanisms and bring on the love scenes!br br Gere plays a plastic surgeon who lost a female patient during a routine surgery for a benign cyst on her cheek Of course she died of an overdose of ANESTHESIA so you wonder right away why the surgeon is guilted up and not the anesthesiologist! HELLO! where is that guy? Why is the wrong doctor feeling guilty?br br Gere has come to pout and confront the womans husband and is staying at the remote B&Bwho should be there why the ONLY OTHER PERSON IN THE INNDiane Lane! Shes a lonely divorcée with rotten kids and an ex-hubby who wants her back While shes trying to decide about that the cliché best black friend has her subbing as hostess at the B&Bbr br Now in the real world if this set up ever even happened the doctor would look like Ernest Borgnineand the lonely divorcée like Rosie ODonnell Hed spend his vacation horndogging 22 year old girls on the beach while she sulked and thought about going on a diet But this isnt the real world; I digressbr br The couple confess all fall in love a hurricane hitsthey make love fall in love he has to go away he dies and she cries a lot about that The endbr br There Ive saved you from it; now you dont have to torture yourself or any male acquaintances (husbands sons boyfriends) from sitting through this tripe Very wearyingbr br Someone else asked why Diane Lane a perfect tiny woman (whom filmmakers seem to love to cast because shes just pretty and thin enough that most women would like to look like her but shes 45ish and not over-the-top so she isnt threatening) is constantly covered in big tarp-like shawls This would make sense if she was chubby but she isntbr br Anyways someone throw a pretty paisley shawl over this film So we dont have to watch it Conclusion: read a book unless you are too sick If too sick go to sleep
If you read the book before seeing the movie you may be disappointed like I was The book was great and I was sure after seeing the movie preview that the movie would be great as well however I felt like I was watching a movie where the director and cast did not even read what these characters where like The movie is short and they do not really ever make us feel that these people were truly in love and felt like sole mates Even if the movie did not go in the same direction as the book at least they could of made the romance between these two characters feel more intense I think both Diane Lane and Richard Gere were perfect for these two characters and they have good chemistry however they just did not develop a long enough storyline for us to see how they longed for each other The book was true love story and I think this movie could of been a lot better
Let me get this straight:br br Hotshot plastic surgeon loses a patient on the operating table while removing a cyst from her face and ends up falling in love with recently separated bed and breakfast hostess within about 24 hours of meeting her due to her solid advice on bedside mannerbr br Wow Move over The Notebook theres a new kid in townbr br Where to begin Well how about the depth of this relationship? I think we can safely sum up the foundation of this undying love in the following steps:br br 1 Exchange polite pleasantries over a bite of salad 2 Drink copious amounts of Jack Daniels; play basketball with old food 3 Provide glib unsolicited advice to each other on your crappy lives 4 Make love during a hurricane 5 Devote your lives to each other via airmailbr br I noticed George C Wolfe has The Hairball and United Kanye West Project in his dossier Would stick to your genre be too harsh? Enough said I think most would agree that the best love stories make us cry or laugh or even hope But the reason they are able to do that is that somewhere during the storyline we really start to care about the characters were watching on screen To make us care there must be time spent developing these characterstheir lives their history why were watching them now Wolfe didnt seem to want to waste our time with such trivialities and instead provided us with all of about 8 minutes of background information on each character before hurling us into an intense one-on-one interaction between two ACTORS weve all come to adore but two CHARACTERS we could care less aboutbr br For one brief tender moment when Richard Gere exclaims that he doesnt expect her to listen to his problems and she invites him for dinner the viewer sees a glimmer - a beginning - of something special between these two characters But instead of being allowed to enjoy the anticipation and playfulness of what happens next in the wonderful unpredictable joy that is courtship we are instead pushed headlong into a love affair between two people we hardly knowbr br Lets face it We have all heard cheesy one liners in Romantic films But the reason we cut some slack to Bogart in Casablanca or Nicholson in Somethings Gotta Give is because our hearts and minds have been lifted to the heavens and dragged through the mud and back again with these characters and by the time they deliver the line were so deeply involved with their plight we dont even notice the cheese factor Since Wolfe doesnt allow us to love or even like our protagonists all were left with a fromage sandwich and a few snickers in the audiencebr br Wolfe takes the old Hollywood directors phrase cut to the chase much too literally here As each stilted one liner is delivered by our cast the viewer is left wondering if director Wolfe is subliminally saying to the audience: cmon its a Richard Gere romance just buy inbr br It is as a result of this stunning lack of character - or relationship - development that the films climax fails miserably to tug at our hearts When Geres character dies I felt like I was watching the news about someone I didnt know passing away Or watching a ladies eights rowing race during the beijing olympics Just Didnt Carebr br Epic Fail
I like all different types of movies so this is not a bash on romantic movies from a guy who only likes The Matrix etc etcbr br I just felt it was a lousy movie I dont feel that there was enough buildup of the characters to fall in love They were there for a few days and while dealing with a severe hurricane and major issues in each of their lives Richard Gere and Diane Lane fall hopelessly and helplessly in love?? It isnt realistic This movie didnt make me buy into it and feel it emotionally and that is something that you look for in a good plot Some emotional connection If someone can relate to them falling in love that quickly without any true substance  than so be it You are neither right or wrong Different strokes for different folksbr br Another very unbelievable component to the movie was Diane Lanes very rude teenage daughter becoming nice and sympathetic at the end of the movie Does a teenage girl who is that miserable and aggravated at her mother for not getting back with her cheating husband going to just have a switch turn on and be nice? This movie in a nutshell had some big names but to me was a major disappointment
Wow Not because of the 3-D imagery which at times was used nicely to provide good deep imagery but what a lame ending! The end of the movie just seems to implode on itself This film has got to be one of the goofiest movie monsters ever and one of the most pathetic attempts to try to explain it The misogyny of this film is painful as well If you are looking for a bad 50s sci-fi film to laugh at (aka bot fodder) go for it Otherwise look for better films
In all honesty I havent seen this film for many years but the few times I have tend to make parts of it stick in my memory as anyone who has seen it will understand I first saw it as a child at a YMCA Halloween party in the early Sixties and it scared the hell out of us kids in a fun way I remember feeling genuine anxiety about the unknown thing lurking in the maze I cant risk giving away the ending except to say that it was surprising to say the least I remember vaguely the entire audience of young boys letting out a big scared holler followed by laughter when the terrible secret was revealed The ending has been seen by most viewers as one of the greatest unintentionally funny climaxes to a movie in film history and yet oddly moving in a way You have to see it for yourself which is not easy these days I dont know if its available on home video or not but it would still make a great Halloween feature for both kids and adults
Ive seen a lot of bad movies in my life Date Movie That was bad But thisthis is justits not good House Party 4 is the worst movie ever Its as simple as that Its basically Ferris Bueller with black people in it Oh and its not funny Its awful So awful Chris Stokes may be a superstar on BET but hes an idiot He cant write a comedy Or a horror movie I like to refer to him as a blacker lesser-known Uwe Boll Except Uwe Bolls films are funny awful if you know what I mean You can invite some buddies over pop in Alone In The Dark and have a great time laughing and eating snacks with your buddies Chris Stokes is like that except if you invite friends over to watch House Party 4 with you no one will be laughing Not even the biased token black guy or the illiterate jock Im serious I didnt laugh once throughout this whole movie The acting is terrible and the movie looks like a bad indie film What was the budget for this movie? 5 damn dollars? I mean what the hell? This movie just sucks; dont waste your time with this crap Its disgusting
Im not sure why the producers needed to trade on the name of a somewhat successful movie franchise because the title suggests that it is a sequel to the first three movieswhich it is not Even though Marques Houston did appear in HP3 he played a totally different character (he was eight years older) in this film Okayso Reid and Martin werent the most talented and couldnt carry a film all by themselvesbut to trade on the HP franchise seems to me that there could have made some sort of reference (albeit minor) to the earlier movies Im sure everyone who wanted to see it was hoodwinked--into thinking that they were seeing a sequel--not a totally different film with a familiar name And Im sorryKym Whitley is not funny and could not hold a candle to the late Robin Harris Ketty Lester or DC Curry in the earlier films Although Meagen Good and Mari Morrow are a substantial visual diversionI have to give this a THUMBS DOWN!! Just naming the film Down to the Last Minute would have been OK Furthermore the Hudlin brothers (who produced the first three movies) were not involved in the making of this film
Watching this movie you just have to ask: What were they thinking? There are so many noticeably bad parts of this movie you might get the feel that its intentionally poor as some sort of jokebr br I think the worst part about the film is the directing There are so many bad uses of camera angles and other cinematic elements in this movie that are laughably bad The funniest example of this would be in the beginning where the party guests are receiving their invitations by email - The same camera angle is used for each shot (which last an awkward 2 seconds a piece) and the same computer screen with the same desktopwindowprogram etc appear It even looks like the thing is shot on the same set each time The whole sequence was also completely silent with no music or sound effects Overall it was a poor way to convey the idea that an email was being sent all over townbr br If you listen closely you may notice that the music sounds very similar to other movie sound tracks This is no surprise- most songs including the one that opens the movie are in fact slight alterations of scores from other movies (See if you can guess which ones) Also I noticed that the music is not played by a real orchestra It sounds like its been written and played through a low end midi keyboard If you are familiar with the LucasArts SCUM adventure games the timbre of each instrument sounds like something from the IMUSE enginebr br Everything else about the movie just plain sucks The acting is terrible The script is derivative (Ferris Beuller?) There is no joke in the movie remotely funny unless you see the whole film as one big joke being played on a paying audience Dont rent this Dont even watch it when its rerun on comedy central Just forget this - its terrible
I too am a House Party FanHouse Party I is my favorite movie of all times House Party 4 is a disgrace to all of the HPs and to Kid n PlayThis was supposed to be part of a series reallythere was nothing about kid n play in this movie or any of the other veteransyea kid n play was probably too old to be throwing a House Party movie bc its kind of focused on teensbut kid n play could have at least made a cameo appearance  you can tell how good it was bc it didnt even make it to the movie theaters Immature was in House Party 3 so it made sense for them to carry on the legacybut they should have represented rightthey should have left it at House Party 3 I am 27 years old and I have been watching House Party I since I was 11 when it came out in 1990(16 years ago) and I have been a fan ever since When I first seen House Party 4 I was like what are they really thinking aboutThere was nothing familiar about this movie that would compare to the previous 3 movies I thought it was a black Ferris Bueller days off
I saw House Party 1-3 and I loved them but this one wasnt funny at allFirst it cant be a House Party movie without Kid nPlay right? This one sucks and it was more like a black version of Ferris Buellers Day Off than a House Party movieSecond who the heck is John-John?These new characters cant even compare to the ones from the other three moviesNow i know why they put it straight to videoIt has horrible music weak plot untalented actorsand no hilarious jokes at allMy advicewatch this movie at night only if you cant get to sleepThey should have ended the series after House Party 3 since KidnPlay separated after that oneI hate this one am glad my local video store doesnt have this film and never want to buy it or want to see it on Comedy Central eitherJust because Chris Strokes has talent managing an up-and-coming R&B group doesnt mean he has talent directing and producing films am I right or what? Finally the female characters were all dressed up like cheap two-dollar hookers throughout most of the flickIMX separated a year after this flick got released probably due to the failure of this film and are all but forgotten nowadays In simplier terms this movie just plain old sucks!!!!
Ive never saw the first three but I know theyre all better than thistrash Its about some kid who throws a party Wow Sounds amazing(sarcasm) Is it? NOOO! It starts off with a kid laying in bed and hes getting woke up by his mom So the kid pretends to be sick so he doesnt have to go to school He goes to his uncles house and rounds up some people and throws a party I didnt laugh at all while watching this trash I cant imagine someone sitting down and writing down this dialogue thinking Man dis !@#$ is gunna be big yo! Makes me wonder if they even had a script for this movie I watched this knowing it would be bad but usually watching a bad movie makes me feel good because it gives me something to make fun of This just disgusted me TWO THUMBS DOWN!
(Spoilers Ahead!) This same exact plot from this movie has been done before It has been done in Ferris Buellers Day Off! Marques Bat Man Houston plays sick His gullible parents believe him His sister knows that hes faking but she still must go to school! She is mad He has a party with his friends while his parents are away By the time his parents get home he is sick again and his parents never found out about the party I like Immature better when they were in House Party 3 and still immature!
I know it sounds crazy but yes I am a huge fan of House Party 1 and 2 (and proud of it!!) I hated part 3 and then here comes part 4 I was like are you kidding me with this? Kid n Play are nowhere to be found in this movie and that wouldve been okay had they not foolishly entitled the movie House Party 4 as if it was in any way shape form or fashion related to its predecessors Every time this movie comes on late at night on USA I shoot my TV with a rifle Quite frankly it really is just that atrocious hurlingbr br As the only remaining fan of Kid n Play that will actually admit to being a fan (tee hee hee) I was appalled Remember that stupid little boy group Immature? They snuck their way into House Party 3 Okay fine and well but how can part 4 be just about them and nothing else and it also seems like theyre not even the same kids from part 3 confused!!!! House Party fans: do yourself a favor and stick to House Party 1 and 2 and Class Act Beyond that everything else is ridiculous
Sometimes it is funny to watch films implode from your couch but other times it is just horribly painful to both your eyes and your mind House Party 4: Down to the Last Minute is one of those rare examples of when both your eyes and your mind are pleading with you to turn the film off This final installment to the House Party series is by far the worst not just sequel but film released by Hollywood It becomes very apparent early on in this feature that director Chris Stokes loved Ferris Buellers Day Off with a passion I say this because it becomes very clear that Stokes had no trouble lifting the originality of Bueller off John Hughes hands and choosing to create a film completely void of humor You would think that by stealing themes and images from a funnier film your own film would at least be able to generate a giggle or two With House Party 4 Stokes proved that he does not have what it takes to direct a sequel much less a Hollywood film From his confusing and choppy story the inability to make sense of his characters and recycled oldtired cliché moments all Stokes is doing is hitting a bigger nail into the coffin that holds the House Party films It reminds me of that student that forgets about his project due in an hour and quickly slops together super glue macaroni cat hair chewing gum and straws and presents it as Hannibal Crossing the Alps It just looks horrible and you feel embarrassed for the creatorbr br So where did this film first take the plunge into the realm of comic stupidity? Honestly I do not think that most places will allow me to speak that long so instead I would like to hit upon some of the larger topics that hit me the hardest To begin I still cannot shake the Ferris Beuller rip-off It was as if director Stokes was ashamed of having to direct another sequel to House Party and decided to bring in a completely random formula (from a funnier film) and see if he could cut and paste elements from the original series into that formula That was a huge mistake When a director tries to do this what eventually happens is confusion within the audience We think that we are going in one direction but instead we head in another one That is exactly what you can witness in House Party 4 In one instance we have John-John trying to have the biggest party of the decade while also trying to score a record deal (ok kinda reminds me of the original House Party) but then we whisk away to this random island where Uncle Charles is afraid of flying Grandma gets drunk and some idiotic mind-dulling moments with a supposed killer Again we begin somewhat strong and end chaotic This is the confusion in which I speak Director Stokes did not have the ability to keep his hand on either the pulse of humor or the ability to tell a sequential story He would rather cut corners keep the jokes cheap and think that the audiences are idiots than attempt to revive a stone-dead series One would think that when a director was handed that task of filming another House Party film he would walk into it thinking that heshe would be the one to revive it or bring it back to life instead Stokes just wanted to get paidbr br I realize that I am slowly growing older as the days go quickly by but I do believe I still keep my hand in the younger generations culture I listened to rap and R&B growing up but the group Immature never made it to either my cassette deck or my CD player Why? I dont think they ever quite had a following but apparently to director Chris Stokes it would be beneficial to cast them as leads in his new House Party film Didnt anyone at any studio realize that this was going to be in the red rather quickly? Or how about the option to have Stokes himself play the comedic car repairman nothing like a director with no sense of comic timing casting himself as the only source of possible humor It was one of those few instances when I actually missed Robin Harris and I never thought I would find myself saying that to any film Outside of a go-nowhere band playing the lead role I also thought that the remainder of the cast only continued to suck the life out of this film Uncle Charles was annoying when he attempted humor Kim Whitely was completely wasted for her scenes (both literally and figuratively) while  well  everyone else pretty much falls into that categorybr br Where did Chris Stokes spend most of the budget for this film? Not for special guest stars because while this film may have boasted some there were definitely none present at the unforgettable House Party nor the possible dream that perhaps Kid or Play would make one final appearance House Party 4 followed no preset design which ultimately ruined this feature from the foundation down Can anyone explain to me why there was any need to use the escaped murderer who happened to be a licensed taxicab driver routine for humor? Stokes was reaching deep within the bottom of the barrel and only produced more muck instead of substance For once I can admit to there being no redeeming value to this film House Party 4 buried the series and while I do hear that there may be more in the pipeline I only hope Hollywood realizes that this series has died Hollywood needs to let this series end forget about the past and move forward in the future I think a sequel to Whos the Man? would get them started in the right directionbr br Grade:  out of 
A long time ago way back in the early 80s a late-night TV show Fridays came to ABC trying to steal the limelight away from NBCs badly-listing Saturday Night Live It didnt but it did introduce some repugnant sketches and semi-talented comedians to the world Like Mark Blankenfield for examplebr br Which in a roundabout way brings us to Jekyll and Hyde Together Again Which is repugnant in ways all its ownbr br Blankenfield is about as subtle as a pew full of whoopee cushions going off after Communion And about as tasteful too This is just his drugged-out druggist character he played on the ill-fated Fridays show stretched out to feature length And if you didnt like him there why are you reading this review?br br Any time it takes more than one or two writers to write a movie thats a bad sign Then when it goes for dunder-headed jokes that would get you thrown off every improv stage in the Western hemisphere and replaces gags with gross-out things can only get worsebr br A comic take on a Robert Louis Stevenson story? About as good an idea as making a sitcom out of Poes Fall of the House of Usherbr br Aside from a few (VERY few) gags that give a slight grin this whole film is an exercise in waste - wasted actors wasted film wasted opportunitiesbr br No wonder they showed original author Stevenson turning in his grave What more observant a review could they give themselves?br br No stars No not even for Armstrong who should have known better br br Hyde from this one
I did not quite get Barnens O  it is one of the weirdest ones I have watched The soundtrack was quite unusual as well  written and performed by Jean Michel Jarre - it makes the movie weirder than it was I have to admit that I was almost going to change it and watch another one instead at times the movie seemed plain dumb to me or boring  or confusing There are quite a few sexual references in that movie  trough they too are kind of messed up  Probably the only phrase that I will remember out of it is going to be When you are alone you can control things  and I will show them - or something like that The boy in that movie was obsessed with the idea of not growing up  the last summer as a child he thought once  and he sure lived it to the max So if you have few hours to spare you can watch this movie  but you wont miss much if you dont
I didnt really care for this Had they gotten rid of the comedyslapstick and focused on the dramaticphilosophical aspects of the script this might have been worthwhilebr br The more the film went on the less I liked the protagonistmailman He does have interesting things to say but hes also a hypocritical insecure jerkbr br 310
I dont know what the makers of this film were trying to either accomplish or say but they badly failed at whatever it was Unless of course the object was to totally confuse the viewer I watched this movie simply because Drew Barrymore was in it and it turned out that she had a smaller than small cameo in it The whole idea of having this kid go on some wild car trip to win a big money prize from a gas station game and meet up with all sorts of wackos is utterly ridiculous
Im not going to say too much as this movie isnt worth the effort To put it simply the movie absolutely sucked! This is the worst movie I have ever seen The storyline was stupid you couldnt follow what was happening the characters were so annoying especially the main guy I wanted someone to kill that kid and put him and the movie out of its miserybr br Very very bad
Some movies are off-beat but enjoyable but many movies are just mind-numbingly weird Motorama fits not-so-nicely in the latter category Many seem to like it because of endless guest appearances and a total lack of sense but those two things can only take a movie so far and Motorama simply doesnt have any other merits to its creditbr br Motorama delights itself on plot improbabilities Its main character Gus is a cussing 10-year old on a roadtrip across an imaginary country trying to collect game pieces to win $500 million When interacting with adult figures none of them seem to notice or be concerned with the fact that hes 10 years old At first its incredibly funny but it quickly becomes just too unbelievable especially considering the people he runs into and the fact that he seems so unfazed by a lot of the disturbing (to someone that age) imagery going on around him Gus has no depth and as an anti-hero who has no problem causing misery for others to get his game pieces its hard to feel sorry for him when he encounters troublebr br That trouble is provided by a slew of guest appearances each mistreating Gus in more and more strange ways Besides making the already worn-out plot even more unbelievable and less enjoyable the characters share Gus lack of depth and are equally unmemorable The characters actions can get a little interesting but the actors themselves dont add anything to them thus negating the whole point of getting big names (they couldve been played by anyone and the character wouldve been the same) These guest appearances seem to have been signed more for marquee value than anything elsebr br Motorama should be interesting - its a unique idea but theres too little semblance of sense in the script for it to work Incidents that should have a lasting effect on the anti-hero and the viewer dont as the movie quickly moves from incident to incident in the hope that something will eventually make the audience feel sorry or understanding for Gus That never happens as by doing so nothing is allowed to connect it just jerks back and forth as if on a conveyor belt one incident after another With a story so nonsensical it ceases to be enjoyable and a main character who never evolves to care for himself or anyone else on a higher level Motorama has little to offer except a brat sneaking around and trying to get rich Why should we care about that?
This oddity contains Bunuel-like touches but doesnt sustain ones interest A 10 year old roams a bizarro America in a stolen Mustang while the usual cult movie suspects (Dick Miller Mary Woronov Susie Tyrell) commit malicious acts in the name of comedy Like his AFTER HOURS and VAMPIRES KISS the screenwriter delights in making you squirm I remained unaffected due to the broad acting You know youre in for it when Meat Loaf and Flea give the most appealing perfs (And what did this kids screen test look like?

Sigh Im baffled when I see a short like this get attention and assignments and whatnot I saw this film at a festival before the filmmaker got any attention and forgot about it immediately afterwards It was mildly annoying to see it swiping the Grinch Who Stole Christmas heart gag along with the narration the set design seen many times before the whole weak Tim Burton-ish style and the story that goes nowhere And we got the joke about shooting the crows with the 45 the first time alright?br br But I guess whats really unacceptable is that it even swipes its basic concept from a comic book circa 1999 called LENORE THE CUTE LITTLE DEAD GIRL by Roman Dirge! As any quick internet search will reveal I mean what is this? This is what they base a Hollywood contract on and opens doors in Canada for a filmmaker? Give your head a shake as Don Cherry might say
You may like Tim Burtons fantasies but not in a commercial-like show off lasting 8 minutes It demonstrates good technical points without real creativity or some established narrative pace

The movie uses motifs that could be plagiarized from Wait Until Dark (1967) a much better movie by Terence Young starring Audrey Hepburn Dead Silent is a pale paraphrase There is nothing new here -- the hidden object in the doll the bad men wanting it the bad guy posing as a good guy The disability though has shifted : Audrey Hepburn couldnt see the child in DS cannot speak But both stories hinge on the handicap Where Wait Until Dark built up unbearable suspense Dead Silent lets you guess the outcome the story being such a stereotype
The story starts off in the home of a little girl who is going to have a Birthday Party and both the mother and father seemed to act rather quiet and reserved with each other They proceed to give their daughter her present which is from both of them and it stuck me funny the expressions on the two parents faces as they gave their child this gift it was almost like I hope she likes it! There is a killing in the film and Catherine Mary Stewart(Julia Kerbridge)Reaper2000 gets involved with the case because of family ties Julia is working hard to become a doctor and this particular murder disrupts her entire life Rob Lowe (Kevin Finney)View From The Top03 is a next door neighbor in the same apartment dwelling as Julia and he eventually goes to bed with her and tries to help her in other ways This is not a bad film but it is certainly nothing to go crazy about unless you like a film location in Canada and a good looking Catherine Mary Stewart a native from Canada
Julia Kerbridge (Catherine Mary Stewart) is working hard to become a doctor Suddenly Julia finds herself the guardian of her young niece Amanda after her parents are found murdered Julia has a new neighbor the mysterious Kevin Finney (Rob Lowe) Her hectic life comes crashing down when it becomes apparent that the young Amanda holds the key to a terrible secret For she too is now the target of the killers Julia must discover whether Kevin is friend or foe and unlock the sinister mystery before the murderer strikes again according to the DVD sleeve synopsisbr br This thriller quietly falls apart at the seams but it is interesting some of the time Stalker Sean Devines background telephone scene (outside the police station) and Mr Lowes violin (restaurant) are tensely played But early on its difficult not to miss the fact that one of the supposedly sophisticated killers purposely twists his foot in some red paint at the murder scene Unfortunately this is not an intricate plot point; and there are worse story stumbles afoot Overall Dead Silent is not a bad way to spend some time if there is nothing better on or youre into Lowe and his co-starsbr br  Dead Silent (1999) Roger Cardinal ~ Catherine Mary Stewart Rob Lowe Arlen Aguayo-Stewart Larry Day
Rob Lowe must have eaten up the entire budget but I cant fault him for running with the money Even he would have to agree there was nothing good about this movie Filming editing direction dialogue sets makeup writing casting (especially the young girl and imposter child psychiatrist) and the story all were just the worst I have never seen such a horrible movie Pass this one up for any other rental selection or find yourself shouting out vile comments at the TV Dead Silent should be silenced for all time
The first 4 episodes of season 6 are just to throw up to predictable and the worst scenario ive seen Wont and hopefully i dint buy it Also seen in seasons back that episodes about space they did suck even more All i want to say to the people who make this is: dont do whole episode about space because they suck The point is that season 6 sucks even more than the seasons before Gets worse from season to season I got so disappointed and frustrated watching first 4 episodes of season 6 that i just had to write this Only people who are brain washed can watch this crap Seems that people writing the scenario are getting out of ideas for a long time Think that my 2 year old nephew had a better idea for the episode than these people do
people get a clue! I mean the writers dont have one so I would expect you tothis show is SUCH a pale imitation of the 60 show that you can laugh at it! and the sixties show is the one with the cheap special effects and is in B&W fer Chrissakes! Yet the mood and the writing on the old show is MILES ahead of this drivel Get HiP kids! if 98 Degrees or Brittany told you to watch it you would! You know it! Just bypass them and tell all your friends you were IN with the scene BEFORE it became too cool!
o dear god i suffered having to watch this film FOUR times in my sisters house and was it dreadful a story of sex and guns and very cheap unexplained acting unless you are at gunpoint being told to watch this avoid it Ja Rule just proved he cannot act Ving Rhames also gave the most dreadful acting ever in any of his films there was not one part of this film made me laugh or make me jump or feel any emotion i would be surprised people actually enjoyed this i have seem some dreadful films in my life but this would be in my five worst films ever the music in it wasnt good and the storyline i think was made up by a couple of guys who ordered a pizza and just sat down wrote ten bullet points and then made it into a film absolutely dreadful
It is difficult to rate a writerdirectors first effort After all it is one more movie than I have written or directed James Hunter wrote a story that was interesting but suffered from an uneven flowbr br After all the idea that a man (Ja Rule) has to choose between the thug life and going straight is common and even falling in love with the daughter (Tatyana Ali) of the man you killed has been done Doing it again demands something that is original and originality is lacking in this filmbr br I was drawn by the inclusion of so many favorites: Tia Carrere (Trues Lies Waynes World) Pam Grier (Jackie Brown) Frank Langella (Dracula Good Night and Good Luck) and Ving Rhames (Rosewood Dawn of the Dead) They did not disappoint in their performances but they had little to work withbr br Direct to video is becoming more and more common but that doesnt mean it has to be a waste of time Maybe the sophomore effort of Hunter will be more enjoyable
Why did I buy this movie on DVD? Well the short answer would be: I really dont know As for the longer version it pretty much comes down to the fact that I genuinely like Tatyana Ali and she plays Alicia in thisbr br Now does Tatyana Ali give a genuinely good effort in this movie? I must say that it is one of the better and she is shaping up to be a rather decent actress I am very much looking forward to see her in action when better material will be availablebr br This being said this movie was terrible - and my score is given based on this: 1 star for not being the worst movie Ive seen 1 star for the performance of Tatyana Ali and 1 star for not thinking that it only deserves 2 stars there are worse movies for thatbr br Ja Rule should stick to rapping not my favourite rapper to say the least but some seem to like him - and if he is contained there I would be delighted not to see him contaminate the acting scenebr br Ving Rhames: Ah man Marcellus Wallace what are you doing here - you used to be cool man Just because Michael Caine is a fiercely brilliant actor who has been in so many terrible flicks as well as good you dont have to copy him Vingbr br The rest of the semi big names in the cast: Its OK there are bills to be paid and we all have to do things were not proud of time to timebr br The movie itself It so massively flawed its pretty difficult to know where to start Its more like a bunch of scenes thrown in together as were the director to say we need to tell this and we need to tell that There is a story unfortunately there is nothing surprising about or within it To say the least the plot changes in the story were overly obvious and it was therefore predictable what was going to happen all the timebr br To sum up in one word: Reallynotgood
Im usually a fan of art and foreign films but when I saw this one my reaction was it must be called experimental because it makes no sense The action is static while at the same time it bounces from one location to another There arent enough titles to make it clear who is who and what their relationships are Apparently the main point was to show that in the face of murder adultery and generally weird and dissolute behavior the cure offered by the powers that be is to banish a totally innocent black man
This experimental silent film made in Switzerland by an independent British film company is chiefly remembered as Paul Robesons first film Its very artistic with shots often seeming meaningless to the story which is difficult to understand anyway because of the lack of enough inter-titles From what I gathered Robesons wife Adah is in an inter-racial love affair with a white man called Thorne It doesnt bother the cigar-chomping owner of the barhotel where Thorne lives (and she seems to be having a lesbian relationship with a barmaid) but an old lady expresses the towns point of view in an inter-title: If I had my way we wouldnt allow negroes in here Thorne is also called nigger lover by someone in the bar Adah tries a reconciliation with Pete (Robeson) but eventually leaves him Thornes wife Astrid goes off the deep end brandishes a knife cuts Thornes arm and cheek and somehow dies Thorne must have been accused of murder because we learn he was acquitted As for Pete he gets a letter from the mayor telling him it is best for everyone that he leave town So the film is more about racism than anything but in an up note the owner tells Pete The sad thing is they think theyre right Thats the way we are The meaning of the title is a mystery It may refer to Adah being light-skinned (a borderline negro) or to the borderline behavior of of the main characters
This film is about a struggling actor trying to find satisfaction in life especially love which he has not had a taste of for 5 yearsbr br It basically is a film featuring a man with very poor social skills and he says wrong things all the time The plot is hollow and contrived The main character James is lonely but this theme of loneliness is not adequately explored It is more like an empty statement which other subplots stem from Sadness and disappointment after being dumped are superficial There is a serious lack of emotions in the filmbr br It is not funny as a comedy either There are some funny one liners but that is it It lacks the happy and uplifting atmosphere to infect people with happy mood I dont find I Want Someone to Eat Cheese With funny
This is absolutely awful Its everywhere & nowhere & doesnt have any sort of point I have never understood what is good about Jeff Garlin or Sarah Silverman Bonnie Hunt is so above this drivel she must have been personal friends wpeople involved because there is no way she would have read any part of this so-called script & thought Yeah I wanna do that! Most movies I can find at least one or two things that are redeemable or funny There is ZERO of that in this Its extremely dumb There really isnt any other word to describe this This is quite possibly the biggest waste of money on making of film that I have seen in a long time Skip this at all cost youll be glad you did
How i deserved to watch this crap??? Worst ever The acting was awful when i read that this was a comedy i expected at least to smile once - or twice but If you are wiling to loose hour and a half of your lives this is the right movie I recommend just look in a wall or something anything else but watch this film Yoy can even watch a documentary (if you are a guy) about pregnant women i guarantee it will be more entertaining :)The actor in this one (i forgot his name) is not that bad and i am surprised how hi accepted the role Anyway I want someone to eat cheese with is the right film if you want to punish someone
Great ensemble cast but unfortunately a bunch of undeveloped ideas make the film drag One feels not fulfilled at the end after waiting for some kind of conclusion closure or at least an ironic twistbr br It had that familiar Curb feel without dare I say it Larry as the annoying polar opposite The music was there the show about nothing scenes pop up but without any common thread or suspense - it falters as a solo project that ran out of budgetbr br Spoilers: The movie title speaks about cheese but she prefers the rice pudding Is cheese a better selling title than rice pudding? He prefers just any junk food regardless of the sell by date Maybe I want someone to eat cheese-dogs or ice cream in a pirate suit would have at least tied some scenes togetherbr br Marty: this is just not funny and overdone People just dont care about a show within a show A coffee book table about coffee books was funnierbr br Unless you are big fans of the cast save your time and eat some cheese It doesnt even have to be with anyone
As a recent convert to Curb Your Enthusiasm which prompted my viewing of all seasons episodes I expected more much more from Jeffs effortsbr br When I view a film offering a slice of an average Joes life I need reasons to be interested to care to feel and believe And with Jeff Garlin at the helm I also expected a bevy of shining comedic moments This film failed me time and againbr br Jeff plays a living with mom plump sad sack who is a social disaster He has not had a relationships real or even casual for many years He appears to be mostly unemployed and as noted shacks with his mommy dearest Can things get worse? Sure In short order he gets sacked by everyone around him including Silverman Second City (his comedy workshop) and his agent All reinforce his loser status Silvermans fatty experiment was as cruel as it was absurd His obsession with the role of Marty as the means of his careers salvation also hits a big dead endbr br While the films final moments offer a glimpse of better things to come the cinematic journey albeit with occasional golden glimmers was sadly lacking
When they announced this movie for TNT I was excited A Travesty from Donald Westlakes Enough was one of my all time favorite stories After I watched it I was not all that thrilled Recently I had the chance to watch it a second time with my aunt and once again I was disappointed (she didnt like it much either and shed never read the book) In this movie they managed to sap all the charm from the book and turn it into dull mush A big part of the problem was William H Macy I like him fine in other films but he played (TerryCarey) Thorpe as a stammering incompetent yutz In the book Thorpe takes a lot of valium for his nerves but remains outwardly collected at almost all times which is part of the fun SPOILERS follow: They also left out a big part of the story (other than a 2 second glimpse at the embassy) where Thorpe solves not 1 but 4 homicides for the police This is important not just because its funny but because it helps set up the relationship between Fred and Thorpe In the movie Freds betrayal in the end is not nearly as affecting because they dont seem all that close In the book they become pretty good friends especially on Freds side which makes it all the more ironic that he is he one that arranges Thorpes downfall Fred also suffered a bit from casting I love Adam Arkin but he was not a cheerful happy to be alive upbeat sort of Detective character traits which book Fred possesses which makes it more obviously out of character for him to mess with evidence and thus more shocking Patricia and Edgarson were pretty close to the book and James Cromwell was great despite not looking much like Martin Balsam The whole boring boat house scene which was entirely added for the film was much less interesting than the police finding Edgarsons body after Thorpe ships it to Seattle and blaming the death on the mob Kit was okay although she was mostly rewritten and it would have been nice to see her die as she did get slightly annoying I dont mind changes to books to make movies I know they are necessary because of length and difficulty but it would have been nice if some of the changes in this movie had been funnier or smarter instead of duller
this film is an undisguised attempt to appeal to a younger demographic of fourteen to 24 yr olds and an insult to all of them i refuse to believe that that age group is that vapid as to be entertained by this unnecessary remake early in the film one of the characters proclaims i am surrounded by idiots this is the defining moment in the film which goes steadily down from there full of clichés red-herring scares and unexplained events the film is also full of characters who are not exactly brainiacs a formula all too familiar in dumb horror movies and that crappy its so dark i cant see scenes stolen from Chainsaw Massacre but merely annoying not building any tension nor horror its difficult to film in the dark and sometimes darkness is a great vehicle in a film thats suppose to have tension but my own feeling was that the less you see in this case the better maybe he didnt want to wait until morning because he didnt care other than it might cost him more money to do night scenes well or he doesnt know how who knows? unless you have never seen a horror film in your life or you are two or three years old every aspect of this film is predictable and done before warning: Paris Hilton is in this movie enough said all in all a blasé slasher film which begs the question where the hll is the wax?it was treated like a lost leader if youre bored as possible and all other rentals are out or youre just in the mood for a bad horror film which isnt really scaryor youd like to see Paris have a pole smash through her head go ahead and take a chance its not the worst movie ive ever seen but if this is what the producers of this film thinks a younger audience wants i pray that they are deluded a profit-driven film with no attempt to achieve any kind of art nor respect for the genre you know smart characters make for a scarier movie i believe this is Collet-Serras debut as a director besides commercials and music videos he has another one coming out in 2006 called Goal 2 hopefully his goal is to make a better film
Ignore the extreme votes about House of Wax in no way is it either a 1 or a 10 I will try to be of help to anyone thinking about seeing House of Wax or for those who saw it based on the trailer and feel cheated The trailer makes this movie look very promising which is what trailers are supposed to do There is only one thing for sure with trailers if the producers cant cobble together a minute of interesting elements to make a trailer it is a pretty much a sure thing that the movie is a major suck-fest But a good trailer only tells you that a few things about the movie are good it does not give you much idea about the total package Here a little research can be valuable br br House of Wax stars Elisha Cuthbert (whose acting skills are closer to Kathy Ireland than to either her fellow Canadian Sarah Polley or her lookalike Rose McGowen) and was directed by a music video artist formerly known as Jaume in his feature debut These are not good signs but if you are like me you ignore them and go to see the work of Production Designer Grace Walken who was responsible for the look of Ghost Ship Once again Walkens work is worth seeing so much so that it looks like 90% of the movies $30 million budget went to production design The rest went to Cuthbert to compensate her for the abuse she has to take throughout the film (finger cut off lips glued shut tied up and lots of wading around in assorted gooey stuff) By-the-bye Cuthbert looks considerably heavier than she did in The Girl Next Door about one big pig-out away from having a major weight problembr br Which means they had little left over to pay the rest of the cast and crew And judging from the what was on the screen this might actually be true It looks like everyone else donated their time to get their first acting or crew credit Unfortunately whether it was inexperience or jealousy over the pay disparity the contributions of all these inexperiencedincompetent volunteers amount to less than zerobr br Inexperienced Steven Windows DP work was about as awful as you are likely to see and working in league with an incompetent editor like Joel Negran (insert Pearl Harbor here) they manage to take away most of the value added by the production design group Rather than linger over and showcase the sets Window filmed this stuff with bad lighting and jerky-zooming-bobbing camera work Negran compounded the problem with an insane number of disorienting cuts Poor lighting an ADD-like camera and flurry cutting are what you use to hide cheap and crappy production design; not what is needed when the movies only strength is its expensive and detailed setsbr br Chan Hayes did the screenplay and Charles Belden (who wrote the original story) is credited as the writer although except for the title and the use of wax figures there is absolutely no similarity One saving grace is that the movie does not take itself seriously as a horror film and is mostly parody (insert Van Helsing here) The murders are played for laughs too extreme to be scary or even creepy to anyone over age six The audience particularly cracked up when a certain high profile hotel heiress got her homely face run through by an steel bar although her earlier half-baked striptease was the only genuinely creepy thing in the film Another comedy highlight was when Cuthbert sticks her finger through a grate and has it clipped off by the bad guybr br The good scenes take place in Trudys House of Wax a waxworks that has something to do with a closed sugar mill conjoined twins and a lot of roadkill (which Cuthbert gets to bathe in) All this is supposed to be happening somewhere in rural Florida although from the many hills it sure looks like Paul Hogans country (attention location scouts-the gulf coast is not noted for its rolling terrain) The screenplay apparently intended to play up the connection (bad pun) between the two sets of twins but somewhere during production or post-production most of the dialogue concerning this was trimmed Since what is left about the twin connection makes no sense and goes nowhere you wonder why it wasnt also cut to reduce the boredom factorbr br What is particularly sad is that the producers did not have the brains to recognize in mid-production that they had the ingredients for a first rate horror classic-even with the existing cast What was staring them in the face was a chance to go somewhere with the illusion of a town of wax Because it is a photographic medium modern film is intrinsically naturalistic almost without exception prone to creating an illusion of reality Here they had a ready-made opportunity to give the photographic medium a theatrical element of extreme stylization Like an impressionist painting the town creates the illusion of reality from a distance but reveals itself as a highly stylized wax fabrication up close Of course they would have had to find a visionary Director and DP to bring the thing off successfully but everything else was already in place for this to happen
The third film based on Charles Beldens play entitled Mystery of the Wax Museum (1933) targets generation X-tasy Twin screenwriters Chad Hayes and Carey W Hayes spend more time developing the main characters than other slasher movies--a promising start Their condition guarantees an authentic point of view The role of Paige (Paris Hilton) was not much of a stretch for the worlds favorite heiress She peruses In Style stripteases boys chats on a cell and frets over an ill-conceived pregnancy Her regular routine has been altered beyond repair Hilton reached the peak of her performance--not so hot--during the 1 Night in Paris (2004) parody While the pimp-my-ride is in motion she zealously looks for lip balm in her boyfriends (Robert Richard) lap Finally the actress atones for using the N word on the sex tape Director Jaume Collet-Serra molds his take on the twin thing contrary to the theme of the past Each exhibited opposite characteristics back then whereas a pair of either good or bad can come out the womb today However the latter does not rule out the former Childbirth constitutes the luck of the draw Spectators can hardly consider Vincent (Brian Van Holt) a contemporary Quasimodo Granted the recluses share some similarities such as artistry disfigurement submissiveness and murder Yet one small variable between the two makes all the difference Vincent is even uglier on the inside than he is on the out Collet-Serras House of Wax pays homage to actor Vincent Price from the first remake in 1953 The film leaves obvious van Gogh puns to the imagination of the audience Still the choice to split the antagonist in two eliminates a vibrant twist at the end Professor Henry (Vincent Price) Jarrods unmasking receives runner-up but the most terrifying one in horror movie history belongs to Lon Chaney in Phantom of the Opera (1925) As far as the new contender is concerned the aftermath of separation surgery downplays the effect A surgeon should know operating on Siamese twins scars them--physically and psychologically Their father needs to call a couple colleagues--Dr Phil to consult and Dr McNamara to niptuck Despite what the trailers said Wax is not forever In fact you can rid yourself of it by burning it
A horrible horrible horrible film I saw the original when I was a kid and it gave me nightmares into my teens When I found out a remake was on the way I groaned WHY OH WHY remake a good film? Well we can thank Dark Castle for buggering yet another classic horror film This time theyve replaced a somewhat interesting story with gore slower than slow pacing and yawn-inspired characters Someone previously said that she was surprised that Paris Hilton can act Uh were you watching the film? She plays a prissy little tramp Sounds like typecasting to me Half of the people in the audience actually CHEERED when she died! That tells you why people are seeing this film If thats your only reason then find a better one because like a black hole this thing will suck out more of your life than youll want Had I been alone I would have left 10 minutes into the boring exposition This thing is like a morons guide to crap film-making: In bred Southern git stupid but attractive leads knives a plenty gore a plenty stock menacing truck I could go on After watching this film I began to really appreciate Jeepers Creepers and I thought that film sucked Save yourself and avoid this crapfest at every cost
Is this a game FMV or a movie? In all honesty I watched this one out of choice-less-ness It is a very big waste of time and moneybr br It seems HK movies are heading in the opposite direction of the rest of the worldbr br Try to put more effort and money into a production and make us want to watch rather than something you want us to watchbr br The graphics are so horrible than they looked like something out of the early to mid-90s low resolution games (in comparison to todays)br br The way they made this movie is almost exactly what they did in the 90s Wing Commander game namely the third installment of the series Stop regressing and make us Asian look so bad at this compared to the big guns in Hollywoodbr br Sure! They have big budgets and better actors But we have some of the oldest histories the myths and the legends the best technophiles and possibly the largest computer graphic talent base in the world! So what went so very very wrong? Did you start using the same old companies that have been working with you for so many films?! Please stop wasting our time and money This is the reason why HK movies are heading downhill so rapidly Didnt you claim to be the Hollywood of the Orient? Guess not
It borrowed scenes from LOTR Matrix Star Wars etc The humor is so dry contrived and corny that you cant help but laugh occasionally at its inanity and the fact that you are watching it Exactly what youd expect from an HK comedy The average person would enter with an IQ of 100 and leave with less than 80 Stephen Chow is an obvious omission from this movie The humor would have worked better with Stephen The Mandarin version of this movie is not as good as the Cantonese original The graphics are poor compared to its Hollywood counterparts There is overdependence on low quality CG My biggest complaint is its ending The origin of the white horse is so clearly described in the Journey to the West (JW) that this alternate explanation does not work well with story line Despite its many flaws this movie has far more entertainment value than the other movie Nicholas Tse starred in--The Promise
First there was Tsui Harks Zu Warriors (2001) which is visually ground-breaking but much lacking in the acting and writing departments now this movie which is visually almost as good as Zu (though no longer ground-breaking) but is even worse in the acting and writing departments Its really sad that there seems to be an almost complete lack of acting and writing talents in the HK movie industry I guess you need to understand Cantonese to understand how bad and vulgar the dialogs in the movie really are Its like some delinquent kids talking in the street its that bad To make it worse the actors and actresses themselves look like delinquent kids and cant act even if their life depend on it I understand that this movie is supposed to be a comedy aimed at the younger generation in HK but has HK youths really become so brain-dead that they cant appreciate anything but such juvenile and vulgar actingwriting? If thats the case it makes me ashamed to be from HKbr br I wish HK movie makers will learn some lessons from directors like Zhang Yi-Mou or Ang Lee and finally make a movie thats both visually stunning as well as competent and mature in the acting and writing departments And stop using young singersidolsheartthrobs as actors because they cant act however many fans they may have in HK!
Its like someone took a fantasy-type video game and put it in a blender and the resulting scene mishmash is what we have to sit throughbr br Now let me go on record by saying how much I love Chinese fantasy films From the fun and silly to those focusing on martial arts to the more dramatic and romantic typesits a genre I very much enjoy Films like A Chinese Odyssey: Pandoras Box and A Chinese Odyssey: Cinderella (both of which were written andor directed by Jeffrey Lau); The Bride with White Hair; Butterfly & Sword; Green Snake; A Chinese Ghost Story; Swordman II; Zu: Warriors from the Magic Mountain; Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon; and others Which is why I was looking forward to A Chinese Tall Story One of the films characters is the Monkey King (aka Sun Wukong) an extremely well-known character in Chinese mythology first told in the stories of the Journey to the West the epic adventure written about 500 years ago (The story of the Monkey King and his disciples is also the focus of the Chinese Odyssey films amongst many others) Other familiar characters that appear in the film are Zhu Wuneng (the pig character) and Sha Wujingbr br So how does it all go wrong? Well lets take an example familiar to Western audiences How about the Robin Hood mythology? A well known story from ye olden days Lets say that our Robin Hood film starred Wesley Snipes as Robin Hood and Haley Joel Osment as Friar Tuck Maid Marian is none other than Rosie Perez Lets give Sir Robin an Uzi as well because you never know when you might have to waste the Sheriff of Nottingham They might need rocket packs also and while were at it give them a tactical nuclear weapon because that sure could come in handy If you think this sounds like a really neat retelling of the Robin Hood tale then A Chinese Tall Story is the movie for you! As I indicated above this movie is a jumbled mess In the first 30 minutes we are introduced not only to Sun Wukong Zhu Wuneng and Sha Wujing but also to the monk Tripitaka (who is actually the main protagonist) kidnapped children a millennium bug demon (which shoots laser beams) an underground Tree God a lizard imp tribe an angelic girl in an intergalactic egg the Lord Chancellor Tortoise a Sea Dragon King a ever-morphing magic golden staff a chatterbox imp girl wormholes in space and the Four Heavenly Knights All this wouldnt be too bad--the tales and myths passed down over the years certainly do have all sorts of fantastical elements But I guarantee you the Chinese mythology does not include much of the stuff we get subjected to in the last half of the film (Helpful advice to the filmmakers: Just because your computer effects guys CAN come up with cool looking spaceships and depictions of intergalactic war does not mean they SHOULD)br br You know your Chinese mythology movie is on the wrong track when the director asks (and I am not making this upits a direct quote from the commentary) I asked the composer whether or not we can have a more rock-and-roll type music when she transforms into some kind of android-like thing Is there a story hidden in here somewhere? Yes Yes there is Most of the adventure follows Tripitaka (played by Nicholas TseGen-X Cops Time and Tide My Schoolmate the Barbarian) and Meiyan the lizard imp girl (played by Charlene Choi and a computer) Choi is the best thing going in this film You may know her as half of the Canto-pop group Twins and from other films such as The Twins Effect (a fun flick) and Just One Look (a surprisingly good dramaromancecomedy) Poor Choi being a lizard imp and all is hardly recognizable with her warts snagged out teeth doughy nose and hunched back That is until the computers get a hold of and beautify her which somehow makes it worse Tse is passable but all of the supporting actors were abysmal A couple of recognizable faces in bit parts are wastedbr br At one point I was debating with myself if A Chinese Tall Story was a spoof I was almost able to convince myself that it was when the intergalactic egg girl (played by a very pretty Fan Bing-Bing) got out and lit up a Marlboro (!) while talking with Tripitaka who was practicing martial arts dressed in a Spider-Man costume (!!) But it is not a spoof Of course there is the typical Hong Kong silliness but the movie takes itself seriously enough with enough scenes of romance and pathos (scored with a sledghammering of violins and evocative cellos) and rousing action and adventurebr br You might think that you could watch this on a Netflix rental and it wouldnt cost you anything (Oh but itll cost you all right)br br Is there anything good to say? Sure The colors are vibrant (they are the best thing about this movie) And the filmmakers certainly were trying very hard Too bad all that effort went into a movie that is not much more than a bad video game
I was watching the beginning of this on a Friday mid-day while working at computer at home relaxing a bit after a hectic week and cleaning-up some files and answering some communications Got interrupted a couple of times so had trouble getting all the details straight (although its hardly a work of Hitchcock proportions where missing a detail can through the whole story off-kilter) and besides it was not exactly an engrossing piece of workbr br So during a commercial read the only prior comment here (by mgconlan-1) and pretty much can agree with its detailsbr br Not quite in the category of a film so awful it is fascinatingly good but Id like to catch on tape when run again (rather than seeing it as aired) so I can fast forward as needed and see the parts which I missed this first timebr br Give it a 3 because of the attractiveness of the four primary characters
I do not know what some of these filmmakers are thinking by making the same type of clichéd film over and over where the bad guys (bad girls in this case) win Weak acting and very predictable Nothing original about it This same movie has been made over and over again- not different from GOODBYE LOVER (1989) SLOW BURN (2005) or at least ten other movies with the exact same storyline and ending There are a lot of holes in the movie too It is as if they ran out of money and just stopped filming Or perhaps they ran out of ideas But do not waste your time with this one It will only leave you upset by having wasted your time watching it
I saw this movie considering this as a normal Hollywood movie but then came to know that its a Movie made for TV channelOn my DVD cover out of 2 critics comments one of the critic stephen farber from moviline reveiwed it as A best movie of the Yearbr br All the character were simple and decent performances except the Brains character which never gets scope which director wanted to keeps mystery till end there was suspense till end but when you see the end that lady Police Officer and main culprit had a Lesbian affair seems to be totally stupid ideaGod knows what happens to DAVE the male lead characterbr br The other Critic from Mr Browns Movies said that Shocking and Effective but doesnt quite live up to all the Hype which i saw after watching the Movie for which i was partially aggreei should have read this first before taking the movie
All I can say is this movie is made for the Lifetime Channel on TV which means no solid characters no particular style weak acting all kinds of suggested sex but no-breasts and tushs (because boy that would just catapult the film into the depths of sleaze wouldnt it?) but the heavily simulated sex well thats OK br br When watching these films I have to ask myself when will these types of TV channels and their advertisers ever grow up? I think these companies are actually way behind the times They really have no clue what the younger generation is in tune with and if they knew they would demand we change The whole point of many American TV channels like these seems mostly to regurgitate the same sanitized diluded garbage over and over like a generic movie assembly line I guess it works for them or at least it has Not sure about the future though br br Dont bore yourself to death like I did Seek out some real TV movies on HBO Showtime IFC Starz etc Any channel that puts effort into their work and doesnt have to ask a priest what they can or cannot show
The Lifetime channel aired this in October but I only got around to watching it now Its the old eternal triangle again  small-town Connecticut boy Dave Ford (Matt Long) has a quick fling with his best friends girlfriend Emily Darrow (Emmanuelle Chriqui) on the eve of his departure for law school in New York thinks about her for the next five years while he isnt doing contracts and briefs runs into her again when he returns home after the death of his father on the eve of a big exam five years later and gets involved with her romantically again But director and co-writer Matthew Cole Weiss goes way over the top framing the whole thing in flashback as Dave confesses to murdering Emily her husband and another one of her lovers in front of (here comes the spoiler) a Lesbian cop whos also a flame of Emilys Weiss overdoes the flanging effect by which Dave gets to see chunks of his previous life flash before his eyes even before hes actually dead cutting those in even while Dave and Emily are having sex and thereby ruining the soft-core porn shots that give even some otherwise pretty lame Lifetime movies at least a bit of audience appeal I couldnt help but flash back myself to James M Cain and how much better he wrote women like this in his classic thrillers (all adapted into hit movies) The Postman Always Rings Twice Double Indemnity and Mildred Pierce It also doesnt help that the film ends with the bad guys (the bad girls actually) triumphant and the decent if naïve and stupid hero seemingly on his way to the lethal injection table  or that the actors playing the people Dave and Emily are cheating on are both better looking than they are Incidentally though this film went straight to cable in the US there were some blank spots on the soundtrack indicating where swear words were blipped so I presume this got a theatrical release somewhere in the world
Saw this as part of the DC Reel Affirmations Film Festival I hope they got better movies than this because this film failed to deliver on any of the hopes that audience may have entertained from the fantasy of seeing James Franco without his shirt down to more simple wishes such as decent acting coherent direction character development or actual production values Plagued by film school effects such as freeze frames to show moments of emotional distress and obvious influences ranging from My Own Private Idaho to Terminator 2 this film failed on almost every level to engage the audience After the first twenty minutes of valiantly trying to take it seriously the audience collectively threw up its hands and just started to enjoy the inherent crappiness of the film I could be upset that I paid nine bucks to see it and it was two hours Ill never get back but on the other hand it was an entertaining two hours Ill never get back This would have been a classic Mystery Science 3000 episode
A quick funny coming-of-age matinée romp appealing to the underdog aldolescent in us all It functions in effect as a vehicle for Justin Long who has subsequently erupted onto our screens in the fourth Die Hard via PC vs Mac ads Dodgeball and The Break Up Hes funny earnest and young - a big career aheadbr br A towns worth of college wannabes find a fake website Bartelby (Long) has set up to delude his judgemental parents and descend on the college like it were a short notice Facebook party Lewis Black summises the anarchic philosophy as a stand-in Dean - Longs delinquent friends provide support for the subterfuge and consequent appeal to grander traditions of education and friendship (Adam Herschman deserves special mention for his never-flagging slapstick contribution) Well executed feelgood and instantly forgettable 410
I wasnt so impressed with this film finding it quite tiresome and plain The plot line was interesting a kid creating his own college and enrolling hundreds of kids but the laughs were few and far between The jokes werent really funny and i didnt bust a gut at any of the scenes The characters werent intriguing and I didnt feel for any of them even the dawky fat kid with glasses who tried to enter the frat group It was a good first watch but it didnt blow me away and its not one that I would recommend Comparing it to other films in the same genre ie American Pie is just cruel because there is a film which was laugh-a-plenty This ACCEPTED failed to raise a smile!
Inane awful farce basically about a young man who refuses to conform or better uses non-conformity to attain his objectives-fool his parents into thinking that he is attending a college Truth is that this jerk has been rejected by every school he has applied to After viewing this junk you will see whybr br What a ridiculous name- South Hampton Institute of Technology You dont have to be a rocket scientist to figure out the initials of this school of nonsense Problem with these type of films is that in the end the non-conformist becomes the accepted modebr br Lets step back to the world of reality and call this film what it really is- excessive manipulative junk!
I see absolutely nothing funny---even remotely funny---in this stupid movie An unrealistic silly ridiculous idea--just completely ridiculous Hard to believe that the main character who seems so articulate intelligent and imaginative would not be accepted to any college Even more difficult to believe is that no one shut the place down The actors portrayed characters straight out of Characterville We have seen their lot many a time over in many films Nothing new here I found it on late night TV and since there was really nothing else on I watched the whole boring stupid film What a total waste Maybe if you are a teenager you may find it amusing Films are made for an immature mind so teens go for it The rest no way
Let me start by saying that theres really no reason to watch this movie I only sat through it because I was trying to kill some time before going to workbr br Basically its your typical sophomoric comedy aimed at the teenage set Theres nothing remarkable about it other than the complete ridiculousness of the story not to mention that there are plot holes big enough to sail a Carnival cruise-liner through Obviously this isnt supposed to be a realistic movie its supposed to be funny Sadly it mostly fails on that count as well I must admit that I laughed a few times but mainly in a holy sht I cant believe how stupid this is kind of waybr br If you never see this movie youre not missing a thing
Seriously I dont understand how Justin Long is becoming increasingly popular He either has the best agent in Hollywood or recently sold his soul to Satan He is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing The only film that he has attempted to anchor that Ive remotely enjoyed was Waiting and that is almost solely because Ive worked in a restaurant But I digress Aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits I understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive Lewis Blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the PG-13 rating certainly wont allow The films sole bright spot was Jonah Hill (who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent Superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim) His one liners were funny on occasion but were certainly not enough to make this anywhere close to bearable If you just want to completely turn your brain off (or better yet dont have one) then maybe youd enjoy this but I cant recommend it at all
this movie was downright awful most of the comedic scenes seem stale and trite and possibly the funniest scene in the movie had already been given away in previews the entire premise of the movie is so unbelievable and ridiculous its hard to really get into it the actors themselves portray the most unrealistic characters its not just the fact that the movies so hard to swallow but its how they keep forcing it down your throat expecting you to dumb down and accept it the plot itself is so shallow and easy to predict boy somehow gets rejected from every school he applied to(i suppose he completely forgot about attending community college) and decides to create his own school for fellow rejects all goes well for awhile until the validity of his school comes into question all the while the dorky character manages to woo his beautiful neighbor into falling for him with his witty sarcasm which apparently is a skill only he possesses then comes the final struggle with the students somehow all bonding together and fighting for the survival of the school of course the main character then persuades the state board of education to allow his school to stay alive with some inspirational speech this movie would have been more fun to watch if i was under the age of 16 and still ignorant of all college matters and issues
Synopsis: Kid is not accepted into any colleges He creates a college where he and his friends can party by using their parents tuition money br br Wow A Paean to ignorance br br If you believe that were all OK man then this movie is for you Furthermore you must understand that:br br 1 Kids have it all inside them--they just need to let it outbr br 2 Teaching really stifles the innate creativity that everyone is born with br br 3 Someone else should pay for you to follow your passion br br 4 300 teenagers can live together in harmony as long as you take away those restrictive rules br br 5 Extemporaneous speeches are often much more convincing than a prepared presentation br br 6 If the Board of Education allows you to open a charter school with nontraditional teaching techniques its because they have your best interests at heart (Not that they are willing to let go of low-functioning students who will end up working fast food anyways) br br This movie is one in the college comedy genre ie Animal House It follows the pattern pretty closely Whats new here though is a complete attack on higher education not a parody of the bad elements Its missing the sympathetic insider a professor who embodies the worthwhile part of university life br br This lack of balance will doom this film to the back rows of Blockbuster It is so one sided that I wondered if it was an ironic self-referential take on the whole genre--for about one minute The movie has no deep meaning no layers no introspection Its as if they let some kids who never went to class do what comes naturally And what is natural is what the name of the school is: S br br (Never thought Id say this: Go see something with Will Farrell instead His comedies can be surprisingly sophisticated)
The most accurate description of how Billy Crystal fairs in My Giant is to say that this movie is to his career as Ishtar was to Warren Beatys - it didnt ruin it but it slowed it downa lot Crystal should know the three golden rules of Hollywood: 1) never play opposite a kid 2) never play opposite an animal 3) never play opposite someone that is almost 3 feet taller than you is as innocent as a kid and acts like an animalbr br What is this story? A comedy? I guess but I didnt laugh except at the scenes where Crystal is on his own and not burdened with his (what-is-her-role-in-this-movie) ex-wife or the afore-mentioned Giant Did I mention theres also a kid in this film? Well forget about him The son is brought in to make us feel sorry for Crystal and we do but for the actor not the character Billy Crystal is a funny man If you dont believe me watch him in old episodes of Soap or Saturday Night Live Go rent City Slicker or Running Scared or When Harry Met Sallybr br Giant is more ho-hum than fee-fi-fo-fumbr br 
This is one of the most predictable movies I have ever seen And this supposed to be funny Boring boring boring Find the fast forward button at your remote and use it I cant say I laughed once and the only good feeling this movie gave me was relief when it ended
Im still laughing- Not! Im still asking my myself what the point was I barely got a chuckle this movie sucks It tries to be charming and touching but it turns out stupid I do not recommend it
I saw this movie a while ago and I was looking forward to it My biggest problem was having seen the trailer I was expecting a very stylish marshal arts movie with plenty of action and maybe a bit of plot to think about along the way I was sorely disappointed as it would seem that once you have seen the trailer there is nothing else worth watching (if what you are expecting is as described above) My girlfriend at the time gave up half way through and whilst I continued to watch in the hope that something interesting might happen nothing did I found no attachment or real interest in any of the characters I would say just dont bother unless you have a few hours of your life that you dont really care about losing
Since this show was changed from TSS (the screen savers) to AOTS (attack of the show)it has gone down hill TSS with Yoshi and Kevin Rose Alex etc Made the show awesome then they got fired from TSS for an unknown reason When the show switched to AOTS it became less about computers and more about gaming and magazines It also promoted bands that nobody had heard of or cared about Finally I couldnt watch it anymore once Kevin Rose left He kept it interesting but he went off to do his own thing which is good Kevin Rose now has several online pod casts and shows etc on the REV 3 network Check it out REV3com I think you can get to it by going to wwwsystmorg If you want a real tech show rather than aots then go watch Kevin Roses shows or listen to the tWit podcastbr br J
This show is what happened to The Screen Savers after G4 got its hands on it taking it from a useful source of computer-related information to a show that had as its high point the shoving of a miniature web server up someones posteriorbr br As G4s ratings plummeted they moved away from their original target audience gamers to generic hormone-driven young men adding eye candy to the staff and a sex advice segment Now even the gamers who applauded the show initially are turning away in disgust I look forward to the shows and the networks overwhelmingly overdue and well-deserved demise
As a flagship show Attack of the Show (AOTS) is endemic of the larger fall of G4 TV; it is a show (and a station) that has fallen so far that it parades sex to try and cover its glaring faults Its predecessor The Screen Savers was a venue for troubleshooting technology problems and scouting out the latest and greatest in technology It was a nice show with a likable staff and it was fun to see some of the modding and other experiments the crew could put to togetherbr br The acquisition of TechTV by G4 bothered some longtime fans of the station but early returns were actually promising The emphasis on gaming was a nice addition and I really enjoyed a lot of the coverage of E3 and other big entertainment eventsbr br Unfortunately AOTS now stands as but a shell of its former self Those overseeing the channel have shifted the focus of the channel away from technology and gaming and toward anything that might elicit drool from young adult men The result is that AOTS spends as much time parading Olivia Munn or touting the adult film industry as it does covering games It is so bad it is practically unwatchablebr br While some may get puerile joy out of this sort of thing those who genuinely enjoy gaming may wonder where the good coverage went Equally troubling young gamers who might tune into G4 thinking their getting gaming - that active gaming group between 10-15 - are instead being fed things aimed toward a more mature audience On a channel like HBO or Cinemax things like that are expected On G4 its tragicbr br At least SpikeTV another male-aimed channel has good programming like CSI AOTS and G4 has very little good left to offerbr br Too bad really
This meandering tale of mob revenge is simply not very interesting even with Ed McMahon in a ripe role as the chief heavy Jim Brown kicks ass effectively Gloria Hendry proves again that she can bring life to even the poorest roles and Brock Peters is decent as The Cop Who Plays By the Book Its still dull and badly constructed and even the print shown on cable is now emasculated of its original James Brown score
I rented this movie primarily because it had Meg Ryan in it and I was disappointed to see that her role is really a mere supporting one Not only is she not on screen much but nothing her character does is essential to the plot Her character could be written out of the story without changing it much
DOA is a non-thrilling thriller from directors Rocky Morton and Annabelbr br Jankel The acting is okay and the screenplay is pretty bad This movie also has some moments which will make you laugh at how stupid the scenes of violencebr br are For example someone is shot near a window We then see from outsidebr br the building what looks like that person jumped I laughed my head off when this happened This movie tries hard but ultimately fails Only watch this moviebr br when you have no other choicebr br My Critique: br br Rating: [R]br br Rating Reasons: Violence and languagebr br There was no rating reason available due to its age
POSSIBLE SPOILERS --br br I love Dennis Quaid and I like Meg Ryan I was looking forward to seeing them together being married and all I wanted to see their on-screen chemistry Okay that being said I guess the fact that they are actors their off-screen relationship didnt have to permeate their performances especially with this scriptbr br How stupid can a professor be to glue himself to anyone I dont remember the original but I can only assume that OBrien probably was handcuffed to his leading lady probably in a more inevitable way If I were bonded to someone Id be pretty angry The crush I would have would definitely have dissipated quickly Meg showed not even a little annoyance only slight surprise Dennis would have to take me kicking and screaming That whole section of the movie was so horrible -- especially Meg having to go to the bathroom (#2) between dumpsters in the dark at night Ewww No fing way! br br Whats with Dennis socking every single suspect in the movie Sock first ask questions later Not once not twice but too many times -- I could have kept count if I were so inclined br br The most interesting part of the movie was Nick and his family drama Too bad that couldnt have become more of the plot The assumed off-screen drama leading up to this tragedy I think it could have been written in without distracting from Dex quest br br My blame lies with the writer of this screenplay Unless the director and others doctored it up so much that its unrecognizablebr br I wont even get into the real reason poor Dex was murdered How ludicrous is that Even when Dex confronted the real killer and the reason was explained (a true film noir moment) everyone on screen seemed bored Oh _____ happened Oh (yawn) Dex even says this is a silly reason for a triple murder Oh the tension you could cut it with a spoonbr br If anyone but Dennis had been in this movie Id have to give it 12 star (only because I really have seen worse) but in this case 1 12 starsbr br For Dennis and Meg stars see ANYTHING ELSE
This review contains a partial spoilerbr br Shallow from the outset DOA at least starts as if it might be a slick entertaining piece of nonsense like Finchers The Game Its central character(Dennis Quaid) suffers from a nightmarish sequence of events that appear to be setting up a twisted and cunning thriller But the plot rattles along at too great a pace leading to a dramatic twist not half way through when the character learns that he has been poisoned and has only 1-2 days to live And this simply is too big a twist to add casually to a story Once this has happened the films only chance of success is if it treats the psychology of someone in this situation as its principal indeed its only subject matter: but DOA continues as if this was just a normal revelation like any other you might usually encounter in a thriller The problem is two-fold: firstly Quaids actions dont convince as what someone is his situation would be likely to do; and secondly even if they did convince its hard to care about what happens next when the most significant point of plot has already been prematurely resolved The rest of the film is pretty standard fare for a film of this sort but made more tedious than usual by the characters slightly-treated predicament which logically dwarfs the events the film is interested in Dennis Quaid in the lead role doesnt convince either as a burnt out professor or as a man who is destined to die: Meg Ryan is as often ditzy and annoying Another negative feature is the ugly 80s soundtrack Watch The Game instead which from similar roots remains tight and character-driven whereas DOA drifts into developments that only undermine its own premise As the premise is itself quite intriguing its a shame to see it drowned in a surplus of over-cooked plot
Interesting plot but painfully dull The script lacks lacks acting To me this film compares with Made for TV type movies I was lucky to survive the film without falling asleep in my popcorn I watched this film with my family It is fairly safe to watch with your kids (only 1 semi sex scene)If you wish to see a young Meg Ryancheck out this movie Very 80-ish You will like this movie if you like the combination of depressed people at Christmas booze super glue and tar Or maybe you are like me and have have a higher standard for acting in films However I did like the way the movie began and ended! Mark
Im a fan of the 1950s original and about 20 minutes into this remake I started to think this was going to be as good as the original but it wasnt The motive for the murders was incredibly stupid Two of the lovers in the movie turn out to be brother and sister-excuse me while I barf The main character stops in the middle of the movie to have sex which doesnt make sense considering the situation hes in If the film makers wanted a sex scene they should have put it earlier in the movie before the main character (Dexter played by Dennis Quaid found hes about to die and that hes accused of a crime There is a reason for where the sex scene is at Early in the movie Dexter isnt living life to the fullest so hes not interested in sleeping with Meg Ryan I still feel it would make more sense for the sex scene to have either been cut or earlier in the film and the two siblings not to have been loversbr br One of the dumbest parts of the movie involves a gun fight a couple people getting killed and one person being run over all within 15 yards of a crowded carnival and yet NOBODY AT THE CARNIVAL NOTICES!!! Also in the scene is the tar pits the university where the movie takes place is built on If you fall into the tar you sink to the bottom and in a matter of seconds Not only is it hard to believe stuff would sink that fast in tar but more importantly who builds a university on tar pits I would say more about how stupid the end of the movie is but I dont want to put a spoiler in my post
Great story and great lead actors (Quaid and Ryan) but the movie suffers from bad directingbad screenplay and bad scriptThe lead actors do their part but could not save the movie at allToo bad because this could have been a good 80s style Hitchcock suspensemysterythrillerRyan looked so young and fresh in this one thoughAn ok look for big Ryan fans
Rudolph Matés film from 1950 is given a revamp for the 80s Dexter Cornell(Dennis Quaid) is a university lecturer who used to have a successful writing career but thats now gone down the tubes along with his marriage The initial exposition plants the notion in the viewers mind that everybody has something against him so when the revelation comes that he has been poisoned we are not that surprised unless of course you are familiar with the original Dexter after being told he has less than 48hrs to live decides to trace back his steps with the help of one of his students Sydney Fuller(Meg Ryan) but they find they have many obstacles in their waybr br The film begins promisingly in black and white as Dexter staggers in the rain towards the local police station where he wishes to report a murderhis own but the Huey lewis style 80s beat that accompanies this scene only serves to remove any sense of tension and tells the viewer that this is going to be pretty bad its only a question of how bad? Sure enough we are soon using the old flashback medium but now the film resorts to full Technicolor There are some brief homages to Noir as the embracing couple stand in front of a venetian blind but theres really nothing here to recommend it the performances are awful Ryan in particular doing her usual dizzy blonde with a cutesy pie smile routine The film is a lazy attempt to put some unneeded ooomph into an already fine movie premise obviously trying to cash in one the Body Heat audience the seeming results are undoubtedly aimed at a teen audience and to be sure they are welcome to it 410
DANGER: Watch for falling spoilersbr br Boy was this a bad movie I know that they were going for a true love conquers all kind of thing but about all this film conquered was about 3(which felt more like 9) hours of my afternoon which I will never get back The movie is about two young lovers named Kai and Gerta who live in a remote town in a fantasy world Kai is the much-abused bellboy at a hotel owned by Gertas father At first Gerta ignores Kais advances but she eventually warms up to him much to the disgust of (You Guessed It!) Gertas father As if this obstacle wasnt enough to overcome an evil snow queen shoots a shard of glass in Kais eye and he becomes a mean person treats Gerta poorly Kai is eventually taken to the Snow Queens fortress (Which is the same set as the hotel just covered in ice because the good people at Hallmark like to go all out) and Gerta sets out on a mission to get Kai back Along the way she runs into the 3 other seasons that are evil in their own special way but Gerta escapes them with the help of some dull and forgettable characters she meets along the way (All the while you will want to turn it off but cant force yourself to do it Its probably the most evil and most effective spells cast by the Snow Queen) Anyways I will spare you from the ending because anything you can think up in your head right now is probably better then how they ended it So in conclusion the Snow Queen is an incredibly boring movie which takes the fan out of fantasy
The Snow Queen is based on the famous and very beautiful fairytale by Hans Christian Andersen about a girl Gerda who goes on a dangerous journey to rescue her friend Kai from the clutches of the Snow Queen This adaption attempts to capture that storys sense of adventure and luminously intricate imagery through lavish sets and production design but fails on a number of countsbr br Like so many Hallmark productions the potential of the story is completely undercut by heavy-handed scripting and direction The two actors playing Gerda and Kai are blandly pleasant but forgettable; Bridget Fonda as the Snow Queen looks the part but is otherwise miscast for the role Theres a notable lack of dramatic tension to this meandering three-hour miniseries At least some of the pacing problems can be attributed to the addition of filler scenes that add very little to the original story particularly in the opening hour that introduces the main charactersbr br That said The Snow Queen would be just about ideal for pre-teens with a liking for fantasy and a bit of patience Its great eye-candy without being scary and the acting is pitched at the sort of pantomime over-the-top level that spells out the storyline in very very bold text Just make sure you read them Andersens story too
Sometimes Hallmark can get it right - like The 10th Kingdom - but many of their fantasy films plod and this falls into the latter category The version I saw may have been cut (a demon [?] shown in the trailer and publicity stills didnt appear) but anything that made the movie shorter can only be a blessingbr br POSSIBLE SPOILERS IF YOU ARE UNFAMILIAR WITH THE ORIGINAL FAIRY TALE:br br Anyway the film updates the story to the early part of the 20th Century (?) and makes Gerda and Kay (here called Kai - being a Lexx fan I kept expecting him to say The Dead do not solve puzzles) 18 year olds Hans Christian Andersens basic story is followed: the boy gets a shard of ice in his eye goes bad is taken off by the Snow Queen to solve a puzzle in her palace and Gerda goes to find him having various adventures on the waybr br As the two main characters are older than in the original a lot of time is spent getting them together and in love Unfortunately I was never convinced that they were particularly in love and certainly not enough in love to make sense of Gerdas quest By the time the main plot kicks in the movies pace has slowed to a crawl Alas when Gerda begins her search for Kai it only manages to pick up the pace to a leisurely strollbr br There are a few odd additions to the story that seem to go nowhere At the start of the film the Snow Queen kills Gerdas mother but no explanation for this is given A polar bear living in the Snow Queens palace is more than he seems (though this is possibly because the producers realised that the bears feelings towards the Snow Queen would be OK in a Fairy Tale but not in a modern film) Again this is never explained Also hints that the Snow Queen has an erotic desire for Kai are dropped but never followed through The script is also full of anachronisms that really jar you out of the fairy tale moodbr br The production looks good though there is evidence of penny-pinching: the Snow Queens palace is the hotel where Gerda and Kai lived covered in ice The three main characters are played with varying degrees of success: Kai comes across as bland as does Gerda initially but once she sets off to find Kai you warm to her Bridget Fonda looks great as the Snow Queen but seems to be in a different movie to everyone elsebr br Ultimately the film is unsatisfying It looks good but drags and lacks magic
This 3-hour made-for-TV miniseries came home with us from Blockbusters this weekend The production company clearly spent a lot of money on sets costuming (Bridget Fonda especially) and special effects (including a great Jim Henson talking polar bear & reindeer) They should have spent a bit more money getting a coherent script The story line was so loose that it really never came together One can overlook Irish-accented Germans but not herky-jerky storytelling With senseless loose ends which included a special guest appearance by the Devil this one is certainly not destined to be a Christmas Classic A shame that they wasted good performances by the two female leads
For all intents and purposes Showtime was the worst movie I have ever seenbr br Why? Because having Deniro in the cast adds immediate credibility and makes you want to watch the movie I had also made the mistake of watching 48 Hours and Beverly Hills Cop recently before seeing Showtime and for some strange reason thought Eddie Murphy was still funny Well hes not In fact it almost seems like he has been neutered As I watched this movie I was in amazement that Deniro decided this was a good enough script to lend his name too No chemistry between him and Murphy whatsoever Horrible writing horrible jokes a movie that you THINK is supposed to be good cant get much worse than this Not too long after sitting through the wretch that was Showtime I happened to watch National Security starring Martin Lawrence The movie had its funny parts but wasnt that great But still it was 20 times better than Showtime Please if your a Deniro fan DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!!
I dont understand jokes I do believe this is my problem with modern cinema or those films that are made with millions of dollars in hopes that it will become the next greatest sensation Isnt it odd  people just dont laugh as much anymore and I do believe one of the diseases to that problem is the film Showtime There was absolutely nothing from the beginning to the end of the credits with all of the bantering between Murphy and De Niro with Russo as eye candy with even standard clichés which make the general population swoon with pre-programmed laughter there was nothing in this film that made me laugh There werent the overbearing physical jokes or the calculated mental vocal jokes at all throughout this debacle of a film From the beginning I didnt buy the match-up of De Niro and Murphy as anything more than Hollywood excitement throughout the commentary the director vividly talks about the hijinks and laughter going on during the shoot  where was it in the film? This falls to either two problems  the director really doesnt have a sense of comedy or the editor didnt understand the value of the film Either way they both doomed the entire hour and a half spent on the Hollywood nightmare Showtimebr br Outside of finding no reason to laugh there was no reason to follow these characters through any moment of the film There was a glimpse of humor with De Niros desire to pick up pottery as a hobby (but the director had to write KILN on the machine so audiences would understand  WHO DOES THAT?) but that was dropped and never developed There was the idea that Murphy was an actor but outside of that one opening monologue nobody would have understood that He rents a room in a producers house in which he can afford on a police officers salary? This just didnt compute even for Hollywood standards There was a bad guy who wanted a big gun but the gun was never developed nor was there any true test of the weapons capability  even at the end It became a bigger joke to laugh at an accent than remember the guns Where was the television show in this? Russo had to get permission from this random guy at the beginning but there were no consequences There was nothing in the middle of this film outside of further questions and meaningless dribble Random characters were introduced forgotten re-introduced and forgotten all over again The director and producer laughed at this while we the meager viewer must suffer through inside jokes and cliché stereotypesbr br Was there a love interest in this film? Was there a truly sinister bad guy that went apart from the comic duo to bring true evil to the screen? Were there any pop culture references that didnt come back to Robert De Niro? Was there random chaos throughout this film? If you need the answers to these obviously you wont find them in Showtime The fact that I am riddling this review with question upon question only means that this sub-par (actually well below sub-sub-sub par) filled no quota or resembled anything of value to the cinematic world Sure it had big names and one really neat explosion but there was nothing of substance to this at all It was almost as if the director said prior to the shoot that he wanted clichés but not regular clichés  go with the bad ones The plot had no linear structure The jokes were boring The characters were drab and underdeveloped This ranks below even the best of buddy-cop films I like to give films the benefit of the doubt but nothing worked in this film Not even Shatner could save this film and he even tried hardbr br Overall I cannot nor will I suggest this film to anyone with a pulse The commentary only confirms the pathetic nature of the film with obvious flaws horrid jokes and creators questioning the validity of their work If creators cant stand behind Showtime why should we? I didnt want a Lethal Weapon when I watched this but I did want something like that I understand there was some form of criticism of reality television and the corrupt nature of the media but that message didnt make it off the page In fact I believe I saw media leave the theater first when I watched this Shame carries its heavy hand with this film and I cannot blame it Murphy used to be a big star comedy was his middle name (see Coming to America) but lately he seems to have lost his edge De Niro obviously wants to get away from an image that haunts him but making these sort of films is only going to set him back further One of these films is equal to one Scorsese picturebr br Skip this one I promise it will make your final cinematic days worthwhile Oh and if you laughed at any of the jokes in this film  I am truly sorry! br br Grade:  out of 
Bubbling just beneath the surface of Showtime is a good idea Actually its more like two or three ideas that constantly fight for screentime This film doesnt just have its cake and eat it too; it has the whole bakerybr br Detective Mitch Preston (Robert De Niro) has a drug bust interrupted by the media and a brash cop-slash-actor named Trey Sellars (Eddie Murphy) When Prestons partner is shot he angrily shoots the camera out of the hands of a pestering newsman and the tiff lands him in a new reality cop show produced by Chase Renzi (Rene Russo) In the first of many errors and oddities in the movie that injured partner is never heard from again or alluded to for the remainder of the filmbr br De Niros best gag is his speech to a classroom of small children to open the picture about how TV cops dont act like real cops Funny thing is as the movie progresses his character and Murphys begin to act more and more like the clichés they supposedly clash so strongly with In a smarter movie De Niros diatribe could have played as ironic comment; here it only shows to point out how truly lame the movie is While a spoof of a reality based cop show could be funny the team of writers and director Tom Dey (Who made the far superior Shanghai Noon a few years ago; see that movie instead) seem to be on unsure footing and instead of slamming the TV industry they really let them off light (The harshest thing they seem to be able to say about network execs is they like to play ping pong at work) Russos character has a glint of fiendish delight in her eye but her dialogue and actions rarely match the actress enthusiasm br br With little on screen to keep my attention my mind began to wander and thats dangerous in a movie with this many plot holes For instance; if Showtime (the name given to the cop show) is such a popular smash why doesnt anyone seem to recognize De Niro and Murphy when they are on the job? For that matter if their investigation of smuggler and all around mean guy Vargas is being televised why the heck hasnt someone mentioned to him that they are on his trail? Then again given this villains actions maybe I shouldnt be surprised; this is the same joker who is very angry at an associate for using his new supergun without approval jeopardizing a deal and then dispatches him how? By using about ten of the superguns to level his entire house of course! Thats like putting out a fire with a bigger fire br br Occasionally Showtime gets laughs but there simply arent enough for the films nearly two hour running time Even worse the really smart gags suggest that this movie really could have been on to something if only they had put in a few more drafts of the script Murphy mugs and talks as fast as he can with minimal results and De Niro looks flat out bored through most of this After a completely unnecessary fistfight between cops and gangsters (That remarkably results in no injuries and no arrests) Russos character shouts Thats great television! Perhaps its great television but its far from a great movie
Eddy Murphy and Robert De Niro should be a combination that results in a great comedy Great expectationa often lead to dissapointment and this proves to be the casebr br When Eddy as a police officer spoils a drug deal being done by Detective Robert they botch it so badly that they end up doing a live action reality TV cop show Logic is not a great component of this movie The super-gun that they spend the second half of the movie chasing down confirms it A twelve guage machine gun that leaves large holes in sheetmetal and three will destroy a house in about a minute (without reloading) is as more a fantasy than science fiction A five pound gun firing hundreds of shots per minute without any recoil is certainly the weapon of the future using the technology of the pastbr br It is clear this movie was designed for neither adults nor children so if you are somewhere in between this is the movie for you
MINOR PLOT SPOILERS AHEAD!!!br br How did such talented actors get involved in such mindless retreadedbr br drivel?

There comes a time in every big name actors career when they get sloppy and accept projects that they wouldnt have touched with a 1000 ft pole in their golden days Remember Taxi Driver? That was a fine film I can hardly believe that the De Niro of Showtime is the same actorbr br I would rather watch Time Chasers twice than see this film again If anyone offers to take you to see Showtime or gives you free passes or whatever run away as fast and far as you can
The movie is not as funny as the directors preceding (and only other) movie Shanghai Noon Showtime did have its moments but it did not satisfy me Why it needed to be so foulmouthed I dont know but I give Showtime 
With all the hype surrounding the stars of the movie this movie left me wanting I expected a much better movie considering the inclusion of the talents of Murphy De Niro and Russo but found that the movie fell flat on its face Comedy sequences were overdone and the superior performances of the stars especially De Niro and Russo couldnt save this one!br br  out of 
Two popular actors are paired in showtime like De Niro and Murphy playing a police and an actor Although they share the most screen time together they do not reach their expected performances such films like Analyse This Meet the Parents Dr Doolittle and Nutty Professor The film starts interestingly but becomes a thin ordinary comedy which is quite disappointingIt feels like especially De Niro doesnt enjoy being in Showtime Thats a shame because he really shows his feelings thats what I think Unfortunately if the idea had been used cleverly this could have been a more interesting piece of work and could be followed with a sequel like any other popular Hollywood movie Well I dont think there would be a sequel to this at least casting De Niro and Murpy again  out of 
Watching Showtime I got the impression that the producers got the idea to put Robert DeNiro and Eddie Murphy just for the sake of having a film that co-starred the two of them Other than that I cant think of a reason to justify the films existence Not that it isnt amusing in spots it certainly is but the concept is so completely ludicrous that the laughs are somewhat mutedbr br The thing that really got me was Eddie Murphys character I cant seem to wrap my mind around the concept of someone being a police officer as strictly a day job When I was working person at New York State Crime Victims Board I had to deal with all kinds of cops and they ran the gamut between the really dedicated and some real slugs but I cant think of one who thought that this was just something I do until I get my career going in an area far afield I mean can you really see Eddie Murphy or anyone else going through the rigors of the real Police Academy not the screen version just to get a day job?br br Anyway DeNiro is your basic hard working detective whos on the trail of a major gun dealer Hes undercover and Murphy is part of his backup So what does the showboating Murphy do he calls a reality based TV series like COPS to film the action br br So DeNiros bust gets blown sky high but the producer of the show gets some good footage of Murphy and DeNiro and decides on a new reality based television series So these unwilling partners get joined and try to continue working DeNiros case with all the TV cameras aroundbr br Eddie Murphys a funny guy I loved him in Beverly Hills Cop and in the Doctor Doolittle movies but hes done better things than Showtime and Robert DeNiro certainly has br br I guess Murphy wanted a chance to work with DeNiro and DeNiro must have gotten one hefty paycheck to do this film
I put down this vehicle from Robert De Niro and Eddie Murphy and Murphy in particular the first time but having seen it again recently I can see that it does have some very funny bitsbr br This is by no means to say that this is the greatest buddy comedy of all time but really what can you do to the already exhausted subgenre? What director Tom Dey has tried to do is make it a satire of the clichés of buddy comedy and the media Early in the movie the executive of a cable network asks: How is this different from Cops? when Chase Renzi is pitching the idea of a reality show dealing with De Niros character Mitch Preston (hilariously boring name by the way) Thats when I saw it in a new light that I hadnt previously noticedbr br The idea is to show all the elements of the buddy comedy and put a twist on them De Niros reluctance to star in the show and to partner up with Murphy is right out of every cop film you can think of You can say that De Niro is actually playing himself asking: Why would I do another movie playing a cop? Chase Renzi is portrayed to be a Hollywood phony but if you look at her opening scene again she is merely doing it to save her job She somehow sees the ridiculousness of what she is doing but she wants to succeed despite that One line says it all: Who doesnt want to be on TV? Maybe this is reading too much into what is essentially a lightweight film merely set to entertain but it does give it a little spin that I hadnt noticed beforebr br As for Murphy You got to applaud him for looking this ridiculous Trey wants to be a star so bad that he is willing to sell out everything he comes in contact with Murphy was a big star and maybe it struck a nerve that it is all so fleetingbr br The plot with the gun is of course pretty boring The action sequences are nothing special except the end which required a lot of effort both from cast and crew One thing that I noticed about the villain is that he is dressed like an 80s pop star George Michael comes to mind and that adds to the whole media spinbr br So I trashed it the first time around but what the heck; if you are gonna do this why not point out how ridiculous it really is and De Niro and Murphy took a big chance doing this
I watched Deadly Voyage because David Suchet was in it after enjoying him in the Poirot series And Joss Ackland is always worth watching so I went into the film with an expectation of it being a potentially worthwhile film Alas it was not to bebr br I wont bother critiquing the performances the pacing the cinematography or any other structural aspect of the film; others here have already given their opinions on those elements The only thing I want to address is the films message since it proclaims in the intro that its based upon a true story and therein hangs the films supposed importancebr br Deadly Voyage primarily focuses upon an impoverished black African man named Kingsley who wants to move to the US because he believes that he can make money there Nothing more nothing less -- his motivation is utterly selfish (Of course some people will prevaricate by saying that he was doing it for his family but in fact he decided to have children on the income he could make in Ghana so he really just created his own problem) To that end Kingsley decides to stow-away aboard a Russian freighter bound for New York In the process of doing this he faces harsh conditions racist crew members and other challengesbr br But this is precisely where the film leaves me unsympathetic Why should the audience be expected to care about Kingsley? Simply because he has a goal? Goals arent such a rare commodity that his should be privileged above say the goal of the ships captain or the woman he left at home with his newborn child Kingsleys goal is illegal in the eyes of the US Government It is also illegal in that it steals from the Russian shipping company If he makes it to the US it would involve taking out of a system that he has not put into And if he gets caught the shipping company will be fined $45000 I doubt very much that any of the stowaways care about what their chosen course of action is costing anyone else; theyre clearly just out for their own gain He couldve spent the $1000 he won in the lottery at the beginning of the film for legal passage to the US and applied for residency and a work permit Instead he takes the illegal (and dangerous) routebr br So since Kingsleys voyage is illegal selfish and cannot be ethically justified why should we care about him or his ordeal? Simply because he faces challenges? Why should his challenges be privileged above the challenge of the Russian shipping company getting to New York without stowaways? Because hes black and the shipping company is white? The reason seems to be because Danny Glover (the films executive producer) and others involved want us to root for Kingsley as if hes a hero on some sort of noble voyage But once you accept that illegal immigration theft and a fools mission arent noble at all you cant really care about himbr br Before anyone plays the race card I assure you that I wouldve felt the same no matter what ethnicitynationality the involved parties were Imagine if a British person decided to stow-away in a train headed for Bhutan sneak across the border and collect unwanted Buddhist antiquities to bring back to Britain to sell How much sympathy could the challenges he faced generate? Very little Id bet So why should we feel different for Kingley? Because hes black? Because hes poor by American standards? The filmmakers are banking on us sharing their views that the ends justify the means and that a shipping company being fined $45000 is inconsequential compared to the remote possibility of an unskilled laborer earning slightly more in the US than he couldve if he had just stayed in his own home country I didnt buy it for a minute
I can imagine what happened for this film to come into being: a bunch of studio guys are sitting around drinking gin-and-tonic maybe a joint and one of them comes up with the idea that it would be great if they could find a film that would bridge the generation gap which at that time was about as far apart as Archie Bunker and Mick Jagger Something that both college-age rebels and their parents would find equally interesting-- for different reasons perhaps but still a ticket is a ticket What interested hippies? Asia philosophy pacifism and wild sets and costumes What interested their parents? Musicals eye candy a feel-good script and nostalgia Very well then Lost Horizon the old classic as a musical in color Cant miss right? It was a bomb Lost Horizon by James Hilton is perhaps less than a classic but not a bad novel In broad terms he sketches out a utopian society in Shangri-la The Valley of the Blue Moon near Tibet inhabited by peacefully contented villagers who serve an abbey of iveryi long-lived monks Intruding into paradise is a Gilligans Island-like planeful of outsiders (a veteran of WWI a missionary etc) each with their own spin on the situation -- what plot there is concerns the reaction of each of them to being presented with a choice to live in paradise or try to return to the tumult of the Twentieth Century Taken on its own terms its gentle pop-lit fluff presenting Hiltons own conservative British views in Oriental dress as exotic and as familiar as a fortune cookie As captive honored guests of the monks the castaways are forbidden to leave the valley but never pressed into work or prayer (not that the monks do too much of that themselves) treated royally and given simple yet luxurious accomodations --whod want to escape? In this Middle American Heaven-on-Earth the monks are both cultured and wise the climate is warm the food is plentiful and tasty the villagers are picturesque nonentities and nothing ever changes The nuns are chaste but encouraged to look pretty and even flirt a bit ( the reason given is one of the most hilariously inaccurate explanations of Tantric Sex Ive ever read) Even their religion is nonthreatening: revealed as a best-of-both worlds blend of Christianity and Buddhism theres little to offend any but the staunchest fundamentalist or the oddballs out there who actually knew something about Tibet (which in the early Thirties was a very small number)br br As a Capra film focussing on the adventurecharacter interplay angles it was enchanting; and perhaps Steven Spielburg could have made it fly if hed been around As an early-Seventies Hollywood product the adventure was over too quickly and the updated roster of characters too bland to make much of an impression Deprived of the sketchy suggestive qualities of classic B&W the monastery resembles a de luxe beauty spa in white and pale blue and while at least some of the monks robes tried for historical accuracy most of the rest of the inmates looked as if on their way to a morning massage and fango bath with a couple of holes of golf in the afternoon Maybe Stephan Sondheim could have restored some grit to the story playing up the very real conflict inside each characters reaction; just five years afterwards Brian Eno would have captured the tranquil atmosphere to a T; instead Bert Bacherach and Hal David were given the job of writing the songs which marry Muzak-like melodies with some of the clunkiest New Agey lyrics ever penned Quite naturally for the time every song calls for a dance number which range from the merely forgettable to the completely boring and so is the script which has not one line worth quotingbr br Tie-ins with this movie were legion -- there were everything from cookbooks to posters planned to promote this film and such was the hype that I actually went out and bought the sountrack album Just about the only thing good I can say about it is that it made enough of an impression on me to write this review completely from memory nearly thirty years after -- the next month I read Aldous Huxley bought a copy of the Bardo Thadol and hence learned about real Tibetan culture Moanbr br 
but unfortunately no one thought about having Van killed in order to save this doomed production The only positive thing about him in the film is his nice singing voicetoo bad the songs are mostly insipid and sappy Why did I hate Van so much? Well throughout the film he seemed like he was doing a third-rate Soupy Sales imitation--with lots of mugging bad jokes and way too much energy spent trying to make everyone laugh The worst of these moments was when he was teaching the class--these kids laughed at EVERYTHING he did Heck Van could have read the phone book or showed them autopsy photos and they probably would have laughed! Now Van was not the only bad casting decision in the film--he was just the most obvious Of course having John Gielgud (a lovely actor) play an Asian was ridiculous as well as having Michael York play Peter Finchs brother!! The bottom line is that because of these insane casting choices the film was doomed from the startand the worst of them was the god-awful Bobby Van Now in real life he might have been a lovely person and its sad that in real life he died so young but with the material they gave him here I just wanted to rip out his tongue to get him to be quietbr br Now I also mentioned the songs--egad those terrible songs!! The original LOST HORIZON by Frank Capra was a subtle delight throughout--and not a single song and dance number in the film So why did they decide to add a bazillion songs that did nothing to help the film? They only served to make it seem like a gooey mess--like the original DOCTOR DOOLITTLE combined with LOST HORIZON The end result is a sickly sweet childrens movie--not one that can be enjoyed by anyone over 8br br Now if you can remove these problems you have the basis of a decent film After all the plot is lovely and is still hidden beneath all the goo Peter Finch is particularly good (though certainly not the equal of Ronald Colman in the original) But considering that the original was a near-perfect classic why bother with this sticky confection Who wants to wade through the treacle?! br br By the way this film was included in The 50 Worst Films book by Harry Medved While I too disliked the film it wasnt bad enough to merit inclusion in the book I think it was included mostly because it was such a huge box office failure and because it was released just a few years before the book appeared An excellent book--just not one of the best selections to the hallowed hall of dreck
I was an extra on this film in the part shot at the airport in the first 15 minutes or so; I was one of the fleeing (mostly Mexican) Bangladeshi refugees running across the runways at Ryan Field in Tucson At one point standing around in our turbans as we waited for another shot one of my fellow extras turned to me asked me what the move was going to be about I told him it was going to be a remake of Lost Horizons only as a musical There was a long pause then he replied: Man this movie is gonna suck Pretty perceptive of him I thought I had a good time and made a bit of money but even with some interesting personal memories attached to this movie I cant sit through the whole thing br br If you ever saw the movie The Swarm you can pretty much get the idea You get to see a lot of famous and talented people wasted on an an idea that on the face of it is just BAD The idea seemed to be that if you throw enough money at a movie and hire enough big names then a good story and good writing arent necessary Just turn the big crank and out comes the product Its just not worth watching
To remake Lost Horizon as a musical the need for a Rodgers & Hammerstein or Lerner & Lowe type musical composition was needed Burt Bacharach and Hal David were the wrong choice Having said that my favorite thing about Lost Horizon is its score Its just that the score doesnt fit the piece The cast is made-up of mostly non-musical talents (Ullman Finch and Hussey were all dubbed and still dont sound all that great)br br Frankly the novella on which this and the earlier non-musical film versions were based is mediocre at best While the possibilities for a truly good cinematic musical version exist they are not realized here The film succeeds at being a good rainy-day vehicle to pass the time Otherwise you are better off buying the CD of its soundtrack Only recommended as a curiosity piece due to the films awful reputation Ive seen much better; but Ive seen MUCH worse
This movie would have been alright indeed probably excellent if the directors would have left the interviews and the concert footage separate Into the Void is a great song and I hate how it is cut off at the best part to go to an mumbling interview with Ozzy Osbourne That should have been at the end of the film or located in a special feature The best part of concert DVDs is to put them on and let the music play but Black Sabbath: The Last Supper is hard to put and and simply let play because the music is continually interrupted Nevertheless there are a few strengths to this film; the concert footage when it does play it excellent Black Sabbath returns to the stage after a long hiatus without Osbourne and this film captures that well: Sabbath basically rocks the fans The fans of course have a sweet advantage in the film because they are seeing the band live of course but also they do not have to put up with the incessant interviews that the DVD viewers are burdened with Shame on Jeb Brien and Monica Hardiman (the directors) for doing this to the film! Also shame on Wyatt Smith for editing the film in such a way
I always think it would be nice if you could somehow have a sneak preview at some of the old movies that are re-released on DVD before you purchase them That way you could save yourself some time money and a certain degree of aggro when you feel so utterly let downbr br The Buddy Holly Story is such a moviebr br I do not wish to go into the characterizations or the holes in the plot or the messing around with historical facts that this movie encompasses for I had already come to terms with them twenty years ago when I first began watching itbr br I had recorded it on the old (Monaural) Beta machine back in the early 1980s and liked it so much that it became a regularly-played favourite The best part to my mind was Gary Buseys performance as the young Buddy and his near-perfect vocals and guitar playingbr br I looked forward to the day when I could have it in STEREO and that is where the disappointment comes inbr br This DVD version is (supposedly) re-mastered in both audio and video according to the shell information but Im afraid it left me sadly let-down and glancing at my watch wishing for it to endbr br The sound is murky bordering on the unintelligible and so unprofessionally mixed that it had me yearning for the crystal-clarity vocals of my old Beta tape! br br Despite what you think of the images or the plot or the characters the real draw card here is the MUSICand if you cant hear the lead vocals because they are drowned out by the cymbals or the backing harmonies or other ambients then theres not much left is there? br br Im going to convert my old Beta version to (Mono) DVD for subsequent viewings and put this one where it belongs out with the rubbish! br br Extinction is the Rule Survival is the Exception
The most generic surface-level biography you could hope for Buseys impersonation of Holly is accurate -- but who wants to hear Gary Busey sing Maybe Baby? Typically the members of the Hollies are used for comic relief and melodrama (Smith and Stroud respectively) instead of as people or even characters When Holly uses a string section the old jewish-looking guys who come in tell him hes using the same techniques as Mozart Its just this kind of cheeky statement that makes film biographies like this (and Amadeus about the aforementioned Mozart) so worthless Some entertainment can be derived from Hollys excellent styles and songs done in a B-variation
The best part in this movie is the first one located in Sicily I suppose Crialese shows a good talent for photography and the movie start is delightfully surprising The rest of the story is quite boring Crialese uselessly insists on stereotypical situations and characters trying to melt neorealistic suggestions and video-music technique Fellinian surrealistic remembrances and a very annoying and completely off-topic soundtrack leading the whole thing towards an end which gives you the sensation of an exaggeratedly long story cut abruptly short Frankly this is a real overrated movie and Crialese is a real overrated director
POSSIBLE SPOILERS BELOW br br What a long and mostly uninteresting movie! Who were these characters? Why didnt I care about them? If Im going to watch a movie for two hours Id like to care about somebody or something br br We know that Salvatore dreamed of the riches to be found in the new world Beyond that though we learned little about most of his familys hopes fears etc as they embarked on an adventure into the unknownbr br And why was Lucy even in this movie? She said little; we knew little about her or what she was doing (was she forced to service men in exchange for being allowed to board the ship?) or what her plans were upon reaching New York To those who might suggest that she was needed to underscore the point that a single woman however cultured could not get into this country alone I say that that fact is not enough justification to give her so much screen time That point could have been made in five minutes with Lucy as a momentary characterbr br More questions: Why wasnt the twin brother at the boat to meet the family? We heard about the brother and some closure on that point would have been helpful in giving the movie some cohesiveness Also how long was the journey from Italy to New York? Given the conditions on the ship it makes a difference to the viewer if the voyage took five or 10 or 50 days (Someone said something about seeing land a week at one point but I think that was when they were already en route) I needed these types of details to better appreciate what they were going throughbr br The only scene I really liked was when the boat filled with passengers left the dock br br If you choose to rent this movie do so with remote in hand; you may want the Fast Forward button handybr br Finally may I suggest that with the right voice-over providing helpful information about the times and the circumstances for immigrants--particularly during the slow stretches of endless shots of the countryside people walking etc--this movie might have made an interesting public TV documentary
Being a history buff I rented this movie because of the subject matter The idea of the Ellis Island experience at the turn of the century focusing on one small group is intriguing Unfortunately the movie falls flat Much of the story is simply boring; nothing much happens for long stretches The director uses goofy imagery (offered up in the form of daydream sequences) in an apparent attempt to break up the glacial pacing but instead it clashes with the authentic look and feel of the movie The characters are also poorly drawn In the end we dont really care as much about them as we should Its a shame that this wasnt what it could have been I would still like to see a good movie about the American immigrant experience but this one isnt it
Talk about being boring!br br I got this expecting a fascinating insight into the life of the man who wrote the mythical Night on the Galactic Railroad I expected to see crazy stories and hijinks of an eccentric man and to discover his inspirations for such bizarre material Boy was I wrongbr br Spring and Chaos is mostly boring with only sporadic moments of innovative animation Its certainly nothing to write home about and nowhere near as good as NOTGR which is something that I suggest you watch instead Leave this bore alone If you absolutely MUST see then either rent it or find it somewhere cheap Do not pay top dollar
This is possibly the worst movie ive ever seen it was horribly done it didnt flow it was very choppy because of that many people didnt understand the movie at all I had to watch this movie several times before I got an idea about what was happening OK its like this a kid stole someones car and while running from the police he totals it for some reason the cops let him off and he has to face his parents who sent him to live with his uncle out in the wilderness there he meets a girl who loves to rock climb and he gets into the sport and has to beg his uncle to let him enter a contest for climbing and yeah thats about it like i said horrible movie
As their entire career was a pale impersonation of The Beatles it is no surprise that shortly after the great fiasco of the Beatles Magical Mystery Tour the Monkees would follow up with their own insipid and creative morass of a movie called Head Both movies are not so much a true story with a plot (though MMT attempted to define a plot) as they are a hodge-podge of skits and snippets interspersed with music and songs and out-takesbr br Head has no plot other than the pre-fab-four trying to break free of the box they are in (ie the type-casting of being Monkees and the surrounding commercialism) and yet always finding themselves back in the box Most skits involve breaks in the fourth wall and crossing over into other seemingly unrelated scenes Filled with anti-Vietnam war messages and attempts by the group to show their other talents the film bounces around haphazardly- also to be blamed on the multiple directorsbr br The film like Magical Mystery Tour is now excused by some fans as wonderful symbolism and misunderstood artistic statements Phooey Like MMT it is too many guys with access to too many drugs all trying to make something artsy and making crapbr br Like MMT Head has some clever moments and offers some relatively unknown Monkees songs that are quite decent It does develop a bit more charm than MMT and is a bit easier to sit through but it is not ironic at all that like everything else the Monkees did this was just a mimicry of something the Beatles did first even when it comes to laying an egg
at a Saturday matinee in my home town I went with an older friend (he was about 12) and my mom let me go because she thought the film would be OK (its rated G) I was assaulted by loud music STRANGE images no plot and a stubborn refusal to make ANY sense We left halfway through because we were bored frustrated and our ears hurt br br I saw it 22 years later in a revival theatre My opinion had changed--its even WORSE! Basically everything I hated about it was still there and the film was VERY 60sand has dated badly I got all the little in-jokestoo bad they werent funny The constant shifts in tone got quickly annoying and theres absolutely nothing to get a firm grip on Some people will love this I found it frustratingby the end of the film I felt like throwing something heavy at the screenbr br Also all the Monkees songs in this movie SUCK (and I DO like them)br br For ex-hippies onlyor if youre stoned I give this a 1
The Monkees Head is one of those peculiar phenomenons Ive noticed- that when something doesnt make sense people will try to read things into it and give it great deep meanings which its creator never intended Such is the case herebr br The movie is a stream-of-consciousness spectacle of The Monkees floating in and out of various sketches blackouts set pieces etc similar to the ones on their TV show But while the TV show was played for laughs this doesnt seem to be played for anything except a sort of deep trippy pseudo-intellectual state that this brand of psychedelia imposes All in all its The Monkees doing the same schtick but now its consciousness-raising because the laugh track is removed There is not a stitch of humor or meaning to the whole thing; it just drones on with colored lightsbr br The music in Head should prove to anyone beyond the shadow of a doubt that the Monkees had not a scrap of songwriting ability The tunes are mostly garbage; the only one thats even listenable is Porpoise Song which opens and closes the film But the thing is that was a Gerry Goffin-Carole King song and while its above-average for the Monkees its below-average by Goffin and King standards Its like hearing one of the old Peter And Gordon songs that Paul McCartney wrote for them: you might think its a pretty good song but then you find out who composed it and you realize its a throwaway Mike Nesmiths song is maybe passable the rest is worthless Davy Jones has I guess what the filmmakers imagined to be the big number in the picture since its the only song presented As Show Biz and not cut into a film montage or dream sequence but it falls flat too just because the song isnt any goodbr br I have to admit I always liked the Monkees so the movie is a real disappointment Sure they were cheesy but they were so cheerful about itbr br They knew they were cheesy and they were cool with it But then they got ambitious In Head they actually joke about being a manufactured pop product but the truth is they wanted something more They wanted to be Great Musicians and taken seriously as artists Maybe not like the Beatles but something approaching that Head proves that they failed on all counts 1 out of 4
This is a poor excuse for a movie A film noir done by Busbee Berkeley? Please! First lets forget about the plot a truly simple-minded version of a cynical tough guy turned into a saint by the love of a pretty blonde Yechh So what turns her from despising him to loving him? Along with a group of other guys he helps keep a kid from drowning as they all swim in a water tower and try to survive as the water is siphoned off stranding them It isnt exactly heroics but shes suddenly smitten Its truly painful to watch Claude Rains trying to portray a hard-bitten tough-talking noir-type cop A crooked grimace is his main and rather pathetic acting tool along with a growling voice Most of his energy seems to go into trying to hide the intelligence that shines in all his other roles How he ever got talked into taking this job Ill never understand Enjoy it if you can for a few period details the old cars and gas pumps but dont expect a decent film experience It wasted 1-112 hours of my life
I think Downey was perhaps inspired by French new-wavebr br Who wasnt?br br Unfortunately what he ended up creating here was more along the lines of crackhead new-wavebr br A synapse is obviously a terrible thing to lose and Downey appears to have lost plenty br br Just say no indeed In more ways than one Including to watching this filmbr br I couldnt bear it after a while and began fast forwarding through it It would have been wiser to have just skipped it altogether
Black and white satire of a Madison Avenue ad agency being taken over by blacks Theyre headed by Putney Swope (Arnold Johnson) who is determined to change things However he turns out to be even WORSE than his white predecessors Thats about as original as this getsbr br Im sure this was considered daring and shocking in 1969 but it just seems silly today The jokes are either unfunny (the president is a midget HOW is this funny?) cruel or obvious and the film is full of unlikable characters Its done in a very experimental way which makes it even harder to takeor understand The movie just gets more bizarre and surreal as it goes along The ending comes out of nowhere To make it worse with the sole exception of Johnson ALL the acting is bad Antonio Fargas (a regular in these types of films) is especially annoying as the Arab This gets three stars because the commercial parodies (done in bright color) ARE amusing and theres a rare good line here and there I heard this was a cult classic but this is more interesting than good Skip itunless youre in experimental 1960s films
Writer & director Robert Downey Sr a pioneer of the underground film movement in the 1960s satirized the New York Madison Avenue advertising world with his avant-garde comedy Putney Swope Downey doesnt confine his ridicule to advertising but tackles black militant culture the dynamics in Hollywoods portrayal of race the elite white power structure and character of corruption in any power struggle As audacious and ambitious as Putney Swope strives to be it qualifies as a terrible film amateurishly made on a shoe-string budget with a no-name cast and humor that lacks hilarity Everything about this movie reeks with improvisation Putney Swope stirred up controversy during its initial release with its politically incorrect handling of race issues and consumer culture Like most Marx Brothers movies the plot is thin providing an excuse for Downeys anecdotal gags most of which are terriblebr br The chairman of a prestigious Madison Avenue ad agency dies during a board meeting Before the body has been removed the board holds a secret ballot vote to determine who will replace him Each member understands that they are forbidden to vote for himself Sheer accident occurs when everyone votes for the token black member Putney Swope (Arnold Johnson) since none thought anybody would cast a ballot for him Swope pink slips all but one of the white executives surrounds himself with black pistol packing employees and renames the firm Truth and Soul Advertising Swope decides to alter the face of American advertising He refuses to accept clients whose products are alcohol tobacco or war toys Swopes clients stage an exodus after he becomes the CEO and grandstanding attracts a new line-up of clients that show up at his office lugging bags of money and prepared to suffer abuse from Swopes militant employees Swope exploits his African-American staff too ruthlessly appropriating their ideas after he fires them and conjures up a number of offensive advertising campaigns all of which are hailed as a new wave of marketing genius Incredibly Swopes conservatism proves successful but the agency becomes the target of government operatives who argue Swopes advertising tactics constitute a threat to the national security The high point of this black & white 85-minute comedy are the television commercials shot in color Unfortunately Downey doesnt know when to cut off these ads that consistently start out cleverly but wear out their welcome The funniest part of Putney Swope involves our eponymous protagonists dealings with US President Mimeo in Washington DC (Pepi Hermine) a marihuana-toking midget with a Kissinger-like Teutonic adviser (Larry Wolf) spouting tasteless jokes while trying to convince Swope to come up with an advertising campaign for his new car the Borman 6
Starting with a tearjerking poem and images of american missiles starving children and mutilated palestinians I quickly realised that this was not going to be a objective documentary 5 youths convicted after the gothenburg riots are interviewed and give a very confused explaination why they had to trash the citycenter and then (oh my god) actually have pay for what they have done I kept watching and many questions are raised were the trial properly done and did the cops have the right to do what they did? Lots of questions asked and then dropped No interviews with judges or going through documents about the trial nothingbr br In short: Nothing new from what every Swede has seen on tv a hundred times - just poor propaganda
The basic genre is a thriller intercut with an uncomfortable menage-a-trois Fellowes has tried to make a lot more out of this using the lies of the title in order to bring about all manner of small twists invariably designed to surprise the characters more than the audiencebr br Its really rather messy though Fellowes doesnt seem interested presenting the thriller elements in a fashion that will keep us seat-edged Rather his focus is on the moral predicaments themselvesbr br The dialogue is inconsistent stagey here vernacular there and with the constant surprise of realism undone by the occasional cliché-landmine Though there is no fussing over the locations so that the actors can get on with existing in their space the dreadful score cant create a further dimension and often works against the emotional momentum of given set pieces Theres also a very prosaic dare I say it British feel to the filming I didnt want to see a document of two successful middle class people caught in an extraordinary situation I wanted to see some sort of artful recounting of the storybr br Finally it is in fact the story which lets the rest down Just as the elements of suspense are rather flat so the story is an asymmetric sum of subplots of different shapes and sizes woven as a vehicle for character examination Wilkinson and Watson support this meta-essay with good performances and John Warnabys ebullient colleague Simon to Wilkinson is a welcome foil for much of the brow-furrowingbr br Im disappointed; not that its bad but that it could have been much better 310
First of all I would like to say that I am a fan of all of the actors that appear in this film and at the time that I rented it I wanted to like itbr br I think that the main reason that I was so disappointed was that the outside box promised me a suspense thriller In my eyes a suspense thriller for British movies is like something out of a Ruth Rendell novel something that has a lot of dark twist and turns and leaves the viewer with an ending that is unlikely to be forgotten anytime soonbr br This movie started out with the promising note of being such a film We have our main character that suspects a man that he does not like of being involved in a hit and run that killed the husband of one of his servantsHis notions prove to be right but the idea that his wife might be involved does not occur to him until that she confesses to him that she was a part of the crimebr br The elements of a good suspense thriller were in place at this point but from there I felt that the film took a different direction and became almost some sort of a mild soap opera about who wants to be with who and what the love of a real relationship is The film might have been enjoyable to me if the outside box had talked of a twisted lovers triangle and had not been labeled as suspense thrillerThis seemed to be more of a soap opera story and the beginning setting seemed to be a mild distraction to the true content of the film I felt like this film could have done a whole lot better than it did I felt like it kept leading the viewer up to a big event that never materialized So I have to give it a lower rating than I would have liked to and say that it fell short of my expectations
